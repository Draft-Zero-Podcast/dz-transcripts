00:00:00.005 --> 00:00:03.915
<v Stu Willis>We should put it right out front. I'm gonna put it right from my one piece of advice.

00:00:04.235 --> 00:00:10.825
<v Stu Willis>I got back in film school and is always and only gets more true. Every year I write, which is right, the experience.

00:00:22.370 --> 00:00:31.880
<v Chas Fisher>Hi. I'm chas fisher. And welcome to draft zero. A podcast. Where to? Ozzy? Filmmakers try to work out what makes great screenplays work.

00:00:23.945 --> 00:00:25.175
<v Stu Willis>And I'm stu willis.

00:00:32.745 --> 00:00:45.295
<v Stu Willis>I was coming. Thought you're going to do the emerging filmmakers so I could make the gag that will segue way us into this episode because we've been emerging screenwriters for over five years now.

00:00:45.295 --> 00:00:50.785
<v Stu Willis>Well, more than five years. But we've been doing his podcast for five years at this point over five years.

00:00:50.845 --> 00:01:00.425
<v Stu Willis>And it's time for our and you're way only Now we do it once a year backmatter once appointed time.

00:01:00.425 --> 00:01:13.155
<v Stu Willis>This used to be front matter. We're used to the front of episodes And then we stood at the back and now he decided to wrap it up and stick it into one episode so people can download it and never listened to it, Which is fine if you stop listening now that is cooked.

00:01:14.445 --> 00:01:15.955
<v Stu Willis>Just continue to download us.

00:01:16.502 --> 00:01:19.892
<v Chas Fisher>S. So this is like just for the uninitiated.

00:01:19.902 --> 00:01:26.422
<v Chas Fisher>Backmatter episodes are where we so as, ah, guiding principle in us recording draft zero.

00:01:26.422 --> 00:01:30.212
<v Chas Fisher>We've tried to take an empirical approach to,

00:01:30.632 --> 00:01:42.322
<v Chas Fisher>solving problems that we come across in our own writing and filmmaking craft, and we pick great examples from films that we love, and we try and break them down and apply them to our own writing.

00:01:42.522 --> 00:01:47.812
<v Chas Fisher>But as the years have gone by, we feel that there is, as much as we,

00:01:48.402 --> 00:02:03.012
<v Chas Fisher>try to not hold out our opinions as gospel or anything like that, that there's value in us talking about our careers and processes and where we're at and they've said have ended up bundle together as backmatter.

00:02:03.470 --> 00:02:14.310
<v Stu Willis>Yeah, I guess it's an opportunity for us. Tow. Keep it real and remind every people that a cz muchas we are white men with authority of sounding voices were not that authorities,

00:02:14.970 --> 00:02:24.100
<v Stu Willis>but don't tell other people in our lives that or potential employers where heaps authority if we know exactly how to fix this grip.

00:02:24.402 --> 00:02:27.842
<v Chas Fisher>Well, I do love when I like. I follow,

00:02:28.342 --> 00:02:40.112
<v Chas Fisher>tonnes of writers on Twitter and listen to tonnes of writing podcasts, and I love it when really successful, professional riders are up front about their struggles and all the projects that they've had fail.

00:02:40.122 --> 00:02:50.712
<v Chas Fisher>I mean, for those of you haven't heard it, you must listen to the children of ten do doubleheader episode on pitching.

00:02:51.302 --> 00:03:06.012
<v Chas Fisher>They recorded an entire pitch that they put together, which felt like months and months of writing work and talked about the different studios that they took it to and how the pitch was received on DH.

00:03:06.402 --> 00:03:10.112
<v Chas Fisher>How that process worked. And that was just to me. Such amazing insight.

00:03:10.375 --> 00:03:21.985
<v Stu Willis>Which is a terrible comparison because I'm not sure we're going to offer anything like that. Amazing insights here, kind of more. We're going to keep it real about what it's like to be a screenwriter. That's not in L. A. And not really making stuff.

00:03:25.082 --> 00:03:37.732
<v Chas Fisher>Don't take too seriously. We had literally, recently so soused, often self deprecating. We've had a new listener just say I stopped listening to you when Stu's said that he doesn't hasn't done any writing recently and it's like.

00:03:40.096 --> 00:03:43.336
<v Stu Willis>Yes, I do. I haven't done any writing and we'LL get to that topic governing.

00:03:43.336 --> 00:03:51.736
<v Stu Willis>Done any writing because it's been, to be honest, twenty nineteen has Bean thie Year of Hell from Hey, I just think that's going to keep getting worse.

00:03:51.736 --> 00:03:56.336
<v Stu Willis>But handed in two scripts at the beginning of the year that were both probably proper.

00:03:56.336 --> 00:04:07.566
<v Stu Willis>Real jobs may have two scripts going into production, and I'm saying that up front because one of those script cities nearly going into production, is nearly being going into production for, like, three or four years.

00:04:07.566 --> 00:04:14.956
<v Stu Willis>But it seems pretty likely, like I've seen the potential class list in all that stuff, so excitement.

00:04:14.966 --> 00:04:27.536
<v Stu Willis>But, you know, it says a lot about screenwriting, I think, and the need for lack of a better word social proof that we believe people who have got produced material on DH, we don't.

00:04:27.536 --> 00:04:41.566
<v Stu Willis>But as most of writers will say, a lot of the job of writing will never get seen. You know, it's the tip of the iceberg that gets made, but we're kind of going a little bit off topic of what we want to discuss here.

00:04:41.576 --> 00:04:52.136
<v Stu Willis>I guess that is us trying to offer up some social proof about way should still listen to us doing backmatter, which is yes, we're working on stuff I write, Chazz writes.

00:04:52.146 --> 00:05:03.806
<v Stu Willis>Stuff is moving forward, which is this's five years of just zero presented us an opportunity to kind of reflect upon five years of doing this podcast, not in a putting ourselves on the back.

00:05:04.196 --> 00:05:09.906
<v Stu Willis>Way, but it's an opportunity to kind of reflect upon our own writing processes, and.

00:05:10.396 --> 00:05:12.816
<v Stu Willis>This's the bit wearing it slightly Winkie.

00:05:12.876 --> 00:05:25.466
<v Stu Willis>How draft zero fits into how other people practise into the practises of other writers that dip in and out of this podcast, because I think there's probably accordance that has been with us for a long time.

00:05:25.646 --> 00:05:33.206
<v Stu Willis>But I also suspect that there are writers who get excited about screenwriting. Probably.

00:05:33.796 --> 00:05:46.206
<v Stu Willis>We're trying to learn as much as they can at the beginning. When they're starting on, they keep out of two years and realise that screenwriting is really hard, and they either drop off or they fade or ghost like they're doing online dating, you know,

00:05:47.326 --> 00:05:51.386
<v Stu Willis>and they're taking someone who just like slowly ghosts, um, on DH.

00:05:51.396 --> 00:05:59.611
<v Stu Willis>They feel that way about screenwriting, so for us with fifty five, fifty six, fifty years, seven episodes.

00:06:00.101 --> 00:06:02.711
<v Stu Willis>Let's just say fifty five, because let's not count the first two.

00:06:05.901 --> 00:06:09.911
<v Stu Willis>It's like Quentin Tarantino's first film was not Reservoir Dogs.

00:06:10.501 --> 00:06:19.141
<v Stu Willis>He doesn't mention that, you know, or for those who listen to thrash metal, Pantera never mentioned their first three glam albums.

00:06:19.301 --> 00:06:23.271
<v Stu Willis>There in Really Existed after Phil Marcel Move arrived on the scene.

00:06:24.371 --> 00:06:29.711
<v Stu Willis>I kind of like that. Let's just signal those two episodes. So this is kind of an opportunity for us to discuss,

00:06:30.631 --> 00:06:40.391
<v Stu Willis>kind of the practicalities of how we approach writing, how draft zero has changed, that potentially offer some guidance for those that are beginning their riding journey.

00:06:40.401 --> 00:06:43.371
<v Stu Willis>Or and possibly not a primer.

00:06:43.391 --> 00:06:52.801
<v Stu Willis>I'm trying to think another word for those that are have been listening the whole way, but kind of a moment of reflection.

00:06:53.601 --> 00:07:04.371
<v Stu Willis>What is that? That thing? It's like a dissertation. It's kind of like reflective writing. If you do like creative, work it like a masters or phD level, and you have to do it exegesis.

00:07:04.901 --> 00:07:10.881
<v Stu Willis>That's the term that's an opportunity for youto reflect and perform your own exit. Jesus!

00:07:10.891 --> 00:07:13.311
<v Stu Willis>Oh my God. Ah.

00:07:13.148 --> 00:07:20.258
<v Chas Fisher>So Sue, How has five years of draft zero changed? How you right?

00:07:21.601 --> 00:07:25.311
<v Stu Willis>Do you want to start that? Because I just ranted without a breath for like a minute.

00:07:26.648 --> 00:07:29.178
<v Chas Fisher>Sure, I'LL ask myself that question.

00:07:30.801 --> 00:07:35.011
<v Stu Willis>Hey, Chazz. How was five years of draft zero changed your right?

00:07:35.648 --> 00:07:39.988
<v Chas Fisher>It's really hard to tell. To be honest, my writing has gotten a lot better.

00:07:39.998 --> 00:07:49.358
<v Chas Fisher>What I can really tell from draft zero is my feedback to other writers has improved immensely,

00:07:50.048 --> 00:07:55.458
<v Chas Fisher>because now I can articulate in useful terms,

00:07:56.148 --> 00:07:57.658
<v Chas Fisher>much more precise terms.

00:07:58.248 --> 00:08:08.868
<v Chas Fisher>What I feel is or is not working about other people's work and how I would go about fixing it and presenting options to do that without being,

00:08:09.648 --> 00:08:13.948
<v Chas Fisher>prescriptive or giving examples, but rather approaches.

00:08:14.068 --> 00:08:18.358
<v Chas Fisher>And I feel that because of that, I can't help but,

00:08:18.748 --> 00:08:30.848
<v Chas Fisher>imagine that that also feeds into my own writing as well, so that when I get feedback in there, think saying this this and this isn't working, then I've got much more tools at my disposal to figure out all right.

00:08:30.848 --> 00:08:33.388
<v Chas Fisher>Well, the problem isn't right there.

00:08:33.398 --> 00:08:41.188
<v Chas Fisher>It's actually way back over here, and I need to tweak that scene and layer this stuff in and seed that earlier and swap those two scenes around.

00:08:41.188 --> 00:08:54.028
<v Chas Fisher>And it's, I think, like all things you listen to script notes and they throw out so much knowledge offhandedly, and it's just because they've been writing for so long that it's.

00:08:54.978 --> 00:08:59.668
<v Chas Fisher>Some of that is just part and parcel of their process.

00:08:59.668 --> 00:09:08.728
<v Chas Fisher>And not to say that I'm in any way at that level. But it's certainly I don't have to go back now and re listen to some of our episodes, say on.

00:09:09.878 --> 00:09:19.088
<v Chas Fisher>Tactics or seen transitions because those are things that I'm now automatically doing.

00:09:19.478 --> 00:09:21.188
<v Chas Fisher>So the most recent pilot.

00:09:22.178 --> 00:09:27.988
<v Chas Fisher>Okay, the most recent pilot I've written, I wrote it in two weeks.

00:09:28.378 --> 00:09:37.788
<v Chas Fisher>The structure has not changed at all, and it's only taken three. Polish is for me to go to market with it, which is very, very different.

00:09:38.274 --> 00:09:39.384
<v Stu Willis>Three things like a lot.

00:09:39.878 --> 00:09:40.388
<v Chas Fisher>Yeah.

00:09:41.784 --> 00:09:44.554
<v Stu Willis>I'm just being facetious. Stu-willis.

00:09:42.988 --> 00:09:55.838
<v Chas Fisher>Well, no. All my other projects, they just go through numerous draughts like complete restructuring, taking it back to cards, putting it back together, passed palm, passed palm pass to improve, improve, improve.

00:09:55.838 --> 00:09:59.488
<v Chas Fisher>And anyway, so how has dropped your approved your writing studio?

00:10:00.174 --> 00:10:08.004
<v Stu Willis>Okay, so I'm before I answer that question, I'm going to reflect on the offhandedly because I think this is the goal for me.

00:10:08.014 --> 00:10:14.934
<v Stu Willis>So I'm going to relate it to my editing day job because I've worked in post production for a long time.

00:10:15.184 --> 00:10:25.384
<v Stu Willis>So I went into an agency that I've been working with lately for last week, and one of their junior editors was like, Wow, you're the infamous Ju. I really love your work.

00:10:25.814 --> 00:10:37.614
<v Stu Willis>She's like second year out of union. She's like, how long you've been editing for and I'm going on, learn howto first started editing, play around with editing on Super VHS tape to tape decks and like, the mid nineties,

00:10:38.174 --> 00:10:42.384
<v Stu Willis>and then I'm like, Oh, so but, you know, professionally, maybe,

00:10:42.974 --> 00:10:44.484
<v Stu Willis>fifteen years.

00:10:45.574 --> 00:10:49.884
<v Stu Willis>And she's like, Wow, do you still love it? And I don't know, loves the right word.

00:10:51.525 --> 00:11:04.615
<v Stu Willis>But what I found is the like as you get older, like you realise the value of experience And this is where I like my writing to go is that I no longer think about the craft of editing.

00:11:04.615 --> 00:11:11.225
<v Stu Willis>I know long like I do think about it in the moment, but no longer stay out late at night going or is that a good edit?

00:11:11.235 --> 00:11:18.655
<v Stu Willis>I confined the cut points. I confined the technicalities to make something work easier.

00:11:18.665 --> 00:11:26.555
<v Stu Willis>What makes me valuable for an employer is because I work in advertising is that I have very high level conversations about messaging.

00:11:26.675 --> 00:11:39.705
<v Stu Willis>And in fact, I probably even have a conversation about What is it you're trying to communicate at a level beyond, like ask questions of the marketing people and the crate is that they haven't even thought about right.

00:11:39.725 --> 00:11:43.415
<v Stu Willis>And they definitely I'm not saying that I do it all myself. They provide guidance.

00:11:43.425 --> 00:11:47.935
<v Stu Willis>I just have a visual literacy in relation to editing.

00:11:48.125 --> 00:11:51.005
<v Stu Willis>They do not have, so I can sit there and go.

00:11:51.015 --> 00:12:03.735
<v Stu Willis>Thiss communicates thiss ai communicates this be communicates this Which do you prefer, right? And I think at some point between people like Jon and Craig, that is what they're actually doing. That's where you want your writing to be, right?

00:12:03.745 --> 00:12:10.165
<v Stu Willis>Like you want to be able to go. Thiss is my idea and I know how to execute it. Right?

00:12:10.825 --> 00:12:19.225
<v Stu Willis>And so much of what we've been trying to do with draft zero as much as we talk about house, what we're doing is narrative aesthetics.

00:12:19.225 --> 00:12:28.115
<v Stu Willis>I'm gonna use that word because we talk about aesthetics, land Iran, that what we're trying to get people to do is think about stuff on an execution level.

00:12:28.125 --> 00:12:35.625
<v Stu Willis>What is it that I want the audience to feel and what can I do to achieve that?

00:12:35.635 --> 00:12:46.435
<v Stu Willis>And I think draft zero overall has made me a lot more conscious off that and also more subconscious. So when I'm writing scenes, I don't think about that stuff.

00:12:46.825 --> 00:12:50.775
<v Stu Willis>We wrote a double bang, a pilot man.

00:12:50.775 --> 00:12:56.005
<v Stu Willis>I like a lot of pre had gone in al scene Breakdown was extensive.

00:12:56.505 --> 00:13:09.315
<v Stu Willis>But we wrote a draught and a polish off a double being a pilot in like, three weeks, and it went to market and it good, but the feedback we're getting on it, there's nothing to do with our craft.

00:13:09.325 --> 00:13:12.735
<v Stu Willis>It's absolutely to do with the direction of the material.

00:13:12.745 --> 00:13:22.975
<v Stu Willis>And to me that is a good sign when people are coming back to you, commenting on your writing, not in terms of ***. This doesn't make sense. But is this where we want the project to go?

00:13:23.065 --> 00:13:32.415
<v Stu Willis>That's a good sign, right? That's a sign that out riding on a very basic mechanical level is working fundamentally.

00:13:32.425 --> 00:13:43.675
<v Stu Willis>You want to ask me what draft zero has taught me in me? Reading a whole bunch of unproduced screenplays is that most people don't know how to write a scene, that the basics of screenwriting is seen work.

00:13:44.105 --> 00:13:59.015
<v Stu Willis>But the problem is getting through a whole feature script means you need to under learn the macro A CZ. Well, you need to understand how to write structure So you Khun see through running twenty something thousand words on one hundred pages.

00:13:59.805 --> 00:14:03.145
<v Stu Willis>But what is going to make it work for the reader is Sean's.

00:14:05.035 --> 00:14:08.405
<v Stu Willis>That's kind of like I've read enough.

00:14:08.415 --> 00:14:16.275
<v Stu Willis>I've read about first draught scripts that you read the first *** two pages, and you like they can't even write a scene. I'm not going to read the rest. It doesn't matter if they have their mid point.

00:14:16.515 --> 00:14:22.415
<v Stu Willis>That doesn't matter if they've got this killer third act. If you can't write a scene that holds my attention, it's actually doesn't.

00:14:24.160 --> 00:14:33.810
<v Chas Fisher>And to your point that I think that's another thing that's improved in my feedback is when I get a script and there's something that's not working for me.

00:14:33.820 --> 00:14:40.330
<v Chas Fisher>What I'll say to the writer is, This is what I think you're going for but this is how it's landing with me,

00:14:40.920 --> 00:14:52.190
<v Chas Fisher>on I then don't give them feedback as to how to change that moment, because clearly they want it what I then discusses what you need to do to make that moment, do what I think you wanted to do.

00:14:52.615 --> 00:15:04.525
<v Stu Willis>Yeah, I think in this kind of relates to ascetics. I think for a lot of people when they're starting out, I don't think it's the IRA glass. The gap We'LL put a link into the show notes. It's like the shadow version of.

00:15:05.424 --> 00:15:16.144
<v Excerpts>Nobody tells people who are beginners. And I really wish somebody had told this to May Is that all of us who do creative work like, you know, we get into it and we get into it because we have good taste.

00:15:16.194 --> 00:15:19.734
<v Excerpts>But it's like there's a gap that for the first couple of years that you're making stuff.

00:15:20.524 --> 00:15:26.644
<v Excerpts>What you're making isn't so good. Okay, it's not that great. It Sze trying to be good has ambition. Too good, but it's not quite that good.

00:15:26.864 --> 00:15:36.434
<v Excerpts>But your taste, the thing that got you into the game you have taste is still killer. And your taste is good enough that you can tell that what you're making is kind of a disappointment to you, You know what I mean?

00:15:37.124 --> 00:15:39.554
<v Excerpts>Hi. People never get past that face. A lot of people at that point.

00:15:40.163 --> 00:15:46.673
<v Stu Willis>The shadow version of the Gap, which is that I think a lot of people see their intent, not their execution.

00:15:44.754 --> 00:15:46.764
<v Chas Fisher>And yeah.

00:15:46.823 --> 00:15:56.363
<v Stu Willis>So often they'll get offended that people didn't understand their script because they, under the understand their script and therefore your idiot, for my understanding there script.

00:15:56.373 --> 00:16:10.473
<v Stu Willis>They're actually the craft lies in the ability to read your own material, and this is something we all have to learn to see the original material objectively and see what you've ridden, not what you intended to communicate.

00:16:10.483 --> 00:16:13.073
<v Stu Willis>What did you actually say? Not what you intended to say.

00:16:13.233 --> 00:16:15.413
<v Stu Willis>In fact, that's good advice for life, right?

00:16:15.348 --> 00:16:27.208
<v Chas Fisher>Which is not to say that I can do that. But I built it into my process where I send it to people and get back from them what isn't working, what isn't landing the way that I want it to land.

00:16:27.263 --> 00:16:34.113
<v Stu Willis>Maybe it's now unless we can, like pat ourselves on the backs of more like transgression, transgressions,

00:16:34.923 --> 00:16:42.093
<v Stu Willis>more transgressive, die aggress or Segway into how we used to approach writing,

00:16:42.483 --> 00:16:51.273
<v Stu Willis>five years ago and how I approach it now because I think if there are listeners that air starting with draft zero because they've heard about us and the hitting play on this episode, let's be honest.

00:16:51.283 --> 00:17:05.453
<v Stu Willis>If draft zero is very erratic, we kind of ice skate from topic to topic based on what is interested. Chazz and I and I was over the five years off us writing kind of see our interests have gone from the very kind of, I mean status transactions, basics.

00:17:05.463 --> 00:17:19.443
<v Stu Willis>I kind of think that Austrians actions of basic now, but mid points and point of view and these kind of fundamental building blocks to kind of more esoteric topics. I mean, antagonism doesn't sound esoteric, but then we found a way to make it *** esoteric.

00:17:20.993 --> 00:17:30.143
<v Stu Willis>You know that there is something to be said about how we would just literally approach the nuts and bolts of writing a screenplay.

00:17:30.413 --> 00:17:36.273
<v Stu Willis>You just say you're a novelist and we've had a few numbers. Listen to us. You know, they understand Storey, but they're in stand screenplay ts.

00:17:36.663 --> 00:17:39.213
<v Stu Willis>So how did you approach screenwriting?

00:17:39.633 --> 00:17:43.583
<v Stu Willis>Ahs, muchas you remember five years ago. And how do you approach it now? And where?

00:17:43.631 --> 00:17:50.071
<v Stu Willis>And then is there a synthesis between the two of how you would advise other people to write?

00:17:50.231 --> 00:17:55.391
<v Stu Willis>Like to write how how can they approach it? The daunting task of writing twenty thousand ***.

00:17:56.262 --> 00:18:03.222
<v Chas Fisher>It's okay. So I would outline extensively.

00:18:03.382 --> 00:18:16.682
<v Chas Fisher>I would do so many small documents. I would write log lines one paragraph Synopsys three page Synopsys, ten page Synopsys Beat Outline Step outlines character bios,

00:18:16.982 --> 00:18:18.972
<v Chas Fisher>until I felt like I had enough,

00:18:19.762 --> 00:18:23.092
<v Chas Fisher>to goto go to script on DH.

00:18:23.102 --> 00:18:31.882
<v Chas Fisher>Now what I will identify is I will write maybe the major beats of my script.

00:18:31.892 --> 00:18:43.642
<v Chas Fisher>I always know where my scripts and and so that's just a me thing like I can't even imagine the process that some people go in where they start writing without knowing how they're script ends.

00:18:43.642 --> 00:18:47.372
<v Chas Fisher>Which is not to say that that's a bad thing. It's just I couldn't function that way.

00:18:48.162 --> 00:19:00.572
<v Chas Fisher>So now, so long as I've got my five major beats my processes, I will start out writing a three page summary, and they nearly always turned into ten to fifteen page summaries.

00:19:01.062 --> 00:19:05.402
<v Chas Fisher>Andi, that's the only prep I need to do before I go to pages.

00:19:05.402 --> 00:19:20.372
<v Chas Fisher>Because then what I do is I like to find a lot more stuff while writing pages, because it's just more fun that way. Like how that breaks down into scenes and then who those scenes are with that.

00:19:20.382 --> 00:19:25.272
<v Chas Fisher>I like finding that on the page is opposed to pre planning now.

00:19:25.662 --> 00:19:35.882
<v Chas Fisher>So maybe Dr Zeros help me shift from that process to the latter process. Now, in both of these processes, the plot Israeli the problem.

00:19:36.022 --> 00:19:39.672
<v Chas Fisher>It's nearly always either character moments.

00:19:41.162 --> 00:19:51.902
<v Chas Fisher>How the character's journey is being conveyed to the audience, that I have to go back and rewrite and rewrite and rewrite, and that nearly always all that rewriting generally happens in the first act.

00:19:51.912 --> 00:19:57.872
<v Chas Fisher>Because the storey, how this storey plays out and how it ends is what I want, how I wanted to go.

00:19:58.362 --> 00:20:06.872
<v Chas Fisher>I just have to set up that storey on those characters so that they the audience goes along on that journey.

00:20:07.536 --> 00:20:19.746
<v Stu Willis>What I used to do, and if only enough, On some level I still think about it is Michael's Hague Hug had a sixth stage plot structure and,

00:20:20.376 --> 00:20:32.236
<v Stu Willis>the problem with trying like, In a way, we're trying to outline what would be a screenwriting course, and we're not going to do that where there are plenty of If you want to go and learn how to do nuts and bolts, they're playing online courses that will step you through it.

00:20:33.336 --> 00:20:37.446
<v Stu Willis>But this is kind of like high level thinking from our own experience.

00:20:38.036 --> 00:20:45.746
<v Stu Willis>Michael Hagee has his sick stage plot structure. You don't have to buy his books. I've seen him talk, but don't only books and what?

00:20:44.600 --> 00:20:46.910
<v Chas Fisher>We can probably linked to just the visual graph.

00:20:47.536 --> 00:20:58.546
<v Stu Willis>Yeah, I'm pretty sure we talked about an episode one and two, which is that he broke a storey down into six stages, right stage one, and basically was Act one was broken into.

00:20:58.936 --> 00:21:08.726
<v Stu Willis>Act two is broken into Act three was broken into. This is an important point that I'll get to act one stage one set up, and there is a turning point, which is the opportunity.

00:21:08.726 --> 00:21:15.746
<v Stu Willis>Stage two is the new situation. Then there's a turning point, which is the change of plans Act to stage three. So act, too, eh?

00:21:16.036 --> 00:21:30.696
<v Stu Willis>Is progress. And then turning point three is the point of no return. Then stage for is high complications and high stakes. And then there is twenty point four major setback at three Stage five Final Push and then turning point five's. The climax and Stage six is the aftermath.

00:21:31.316 --> 00:21:45.366
<v Stu Willis>There's kind of two parts that we need to separate more in two parts. There's concept, there is kind of the characters, and there is the plot right for me, character wass and, I think, is increasingly becoming kind of not.

00:21:45.936 --> 00:21:51.896
<v Stu Willis>You know, I've talked a lot about the running condition in the loop, and that's the stuff I'm kind of interested in now and working and writers rooms.

00:21:51.896 --> 00:22:00.496
<v Stu Willis>That's the stuff that I actually think it's the most practical. I also, unlike you, tend to work with co writers so we will spitball characters.

00:22:00.936 --> 00:22:08.416
<v Stu Willis>To no end but often will come back to references to There's one character we've got in the back of their heads that were like she's like his characters.

00:22:08.416 --> 00:22:23.261
<v Stu Willis>Like Annabelle Crab is like this journalist who didn't get into ASIO and so she ends up working for a private spy company. And we've kind of got that. Gives us a feel of who the character is, what they want, what they need with Air Force, their weaknesses, all that stuff.

00:22:23.271 --> 00:22:27.401
<v Stu Willis>Because characters, as we talked about multiple times, are abstracted humans.

00:22:27.701 --> 00:22:39.821
<v Stu Willis>You know they need to make more sent their abstract none in the sense of becoming like Minsky and harder to become inscrutable but the opposite. They become simplified and more defined than real people.

00:22:39.901 --> 00:22:50.901
<v Stu Willis>So often. I'll think about character in those terms, and I find that exercise, which I've talked about before about finding a person in real life and thinking of an attribute.

00:22:51.291 --> 00:23:03.661
<v Stu Willis>You know, The example I've used before is when I was a waiting for a plane that playing the gate next to me was calling for this passenger and, you know, it was like Final call for chas fisher.

00:23:03.671 --> 00:23:15.031
<v Stu Willis>Let's just say Final call for chas fisher. You know the plane is waiting for you and this guy who's Bean waiting at the gate the whole time closes his laptop, puts in his bag on walks on the plane.

00:23:15.031 --> 00:23:19.301
<v Stu Willis>He was chas fisher right. He waited for everyone else to board.

00:23:20.091 --> 00:23:28.981
<v Stu Willis>All right, that is You can build a carriage around that that says something about who they are without necessary. The writing, character, voice documents, et cetera.

00:23:30.747 --> 00:23:34.377
<v Stu Willis>When it comes to planning, I will use the Michael Hey document.

00:23:34.387 --> 00:23:44.267
<v Stu Willis>It's a way of going. Here's your beginning and subdivided to subdivide and subdivisions an important thing because it's your midpoint and as well talk about I've talked about reform.

00:23:44.267 --> 00:23:50.097
<v Stu Willis>Continue to talk about. I think the reason we have men points is that they keep it interesting. They create contrast.

00:23:50.187 --> 00:23:54.467
<v Stu Willis>If we just stayed in stage one set up for ninety minutes, we will be bored.

00:23:55.267 --> 00:24:08.697
<v Stu Willis>So the easiest way to kind of structure one hundred page document it's a lot of writing is to start with something like that and just write those big beats, which is what you do in your outline and then kind of sort them what?

00:24:08.707 --> 00:24:12.707
<v Stu Willis>And I used to do it more fastidiously against the six stage plot structure.

00:24:12.877 --> 00:24:21.307
<v Stu Willis>Now I just write. We write down what the what We think those turning points are and kind of on index cards. Virtual rial.

00:24:21.317 --> 00:24:30.997
<v Stu Willis>But I'm a big fan of either and put them down and then you kind of organism. And then now, because they've got more experience going, Oh, it feels like we need a little bit more here.

00:24:31.267 --> 00:24:36.287
<v Stu Willis>Okay, that actually feels like it takes too long to get out, too. And that's how we start beating out a storey.

00:24:36.407 --> 00:24:40.087
<v Stu Willis>And then I have become a fan of scene breakdowns.

00:24:42.017 --> 00:24:44.907
<v Stu Willis>They work for us, and I'm gonna necessarily work for anyone else.

00:24:44.907 --> 00:24:58.927
<v Stu Willis>But we actually go in a screenwriting programme and go see name, and it doesn't have to be interior, but it's like either location or ah, broad location. House doesn't have to be kitchen because you're not worrying about in in terms of production and just write the big beats of what happens.

00:24:59.067 --> 00:25:03.857
<v Stu Willis>But that is like a stepping stone from Here's like a bullet point outline.

00:25:04.247 --> 00:25:08.287
<v Stu Willis>Two screenplay. But then we'LL take the scene breakdown and turn it straight into a script.

00:25:08.387 --> 00:25:15.877
<v Stu Willis>But the scene breakdown We'LL try to avoid dialogue because really, what we want to see is does this seem work without dialogue?

00:25:15.997 --> 00:25:17.977
<v Stu Willis>And then the dialogue is really fun too, right?

00:25:18.737 --> 00:25:23.857
<v Stu Willis>You know, it keeps us excited, and then you'LL find new things, but you've kind of got a map of where you're going.

00:25:24.347 --> 00:25:32.242
<v Stu Willis>The other thing I've noticed without writing is that my first draughts are now really long. It's not actually a problem, too. Right Words on a page anymore.

00:25:32.772 --> 00:25:36.262
<v Stu Willis>On a good day, I can write twelve pages, you know, which is a lot.

00:25:36.752 --> 00:25:39.922
<v Stu Willis>But off those twelve pages, maybe six. A good if you're lucky.

00:25:40.392 --> 00:25:44.622
<v Stu Willis>But the first document the first draught and becomes not a vomit draught.

00:25:44.622 --> 00:25:52.022
<v Stu Willis>It comes a real draft zero thie processes to Then call it because it's the first time we've given voice to these characters.

00:25:52.022 --> 00:26:00.502
<v Stu Willis>It's the first time we visited these locations. So we're doing ah, lot of what other people would put in short documents within the first draught.

00:26:00.512 --> 00:26:05.062
<v Stu Willis>And then our polish is just like calling the crap out of that and that were ruthless. We know how to cut.

00:26:05.452 --> 00:26:12.862
<v Stu Willis>So that means we, Khun, cut like a third out. But if other people want to put that stuff in supporting documents, they should.

00:26:13.252 --> 00:26:15.072
<v Stu Willis>You know it's the same thing.

00:26:15.161 --> 00:26:23.131
<v Chas Fisher>The whole point of this is not to get prescriptive, were just sharing with you guys as our listeners what our process currently is and how how it's evolved over time.

00:26:23.201 --> 00:26:32.641
<v Chas Fisher>I mean, for me to write that very first script, I had to do all the things that you're talking about in very great detail to write a tonne of documents on.

00:26:32.641 --> 00:26:42.331
<v Chas Fisher>Then I woke up in our early each day and said, I am going to write to pages a day and I got to one hundred twenty page draft zero ages.

00:26:42.331 --> 00:26:56.571
<v Chas Fisher>A day is very manageable amount, but I know writers who write incredible stuff that I could never write, and they do. Zero planning. They're all very intuitive. But then.

00:26:57.050 --> 00:26:58.860
<v Stu Willis>Slash spent a lot of time thinking.

00:26:58.861 --> 00:27:12.221
<v Chas Fisher>Yeah, but then I think a lot of their rewriting process becomes then about structure where a lot of my rewriting process is about effect, not about structure.

00:27:12.221 --> 00:27:23.871
<v Chas Fisher>So I don't really have to generally pull sequences apart or move stuff around too much. It's about taking what I've got and making it do Maur. What I wanted to do.

00:27:24.894 --> 00:27:30.234
<v Stu Willis>If I was to give people advice on how to right now, not to be prescriptive, but they don't know where to start. I am.

00:27:30.574 --> 00:27:36.714
<v Stu Willis>I like index cards, right. You can outline with index cards getting their debts. Cart's right. You're seeing ideas down.

00:27:36.954 --> 00:27:43.154
<v Stu Willis>I want this to happen. I want this to happen on whether this happened this this and this ideally, colour coded per character.

00:27:43.864 --> 00:27:48.124
<v Stu Willis>Because I'm assuming at this point you have an idea of who you characters are.

00:27:49.954 --> 00:28:00.954
<v Stu Willis>Even if you don't realise that even if because you're following someone, right, even if it's just a white because you're falling with one character and you start arranging the storey from that point.

00:28:00.954 --> 00:28:05.204
<v Stu Willis>But I think sometimes bouncing around and working long nearly works.

00:28:05.394 --> 00:28:14.984
<v Stu Willis>If I've done a rise like it's almost like a writer's room strategy Day one, which could be like part one could be that's just spitball. The concept of the characters in the world, right?

00:28:15.124 --> 00:28:23.164
<v Stu Willis>Hey, hey, hey and occasionally be like that. You'd love to see that same love to see that same love to see that scene when your brain storming, you write them down.

00:28:23.794 --> 00:28:31.234
<v Stu Willis>Day two would be or Phase two would be organiz ng all that stuff into a plot structure and obviously, understanding.

00:28:31.234 --> 00:28:39.264
<v Stu Willis>Putting takes experience. But even if you don't have experience, the only way to get experiences, too, get experience and then start organising it.

00:28:39.264 --> 00:28:47.004
<v Stu Willis>And what you'LL find is that maybe there'LL be palm cards off stuff that you like. That's cool scene that you don't need and you set it aside right?

00:28:47.394 --> 00:28:57.154
<v Stu Willis>But that is a way that I would work. So you kind of the process of brainstorming coming up with scenes of separate from the process of plotting, which is kind of a writer's room approach.

00:28:57.154 --> 00:29:08.204
<v Stu Willis>And I think that's still a really great way for writers to start because the reason that they're using in Raina's rooms is it works. They may be more efficient and come up with better stuff because they're experienced writers.

00:29:08.334 --> 00:29:10.404
<v Stu Willis>But the process produces material.

00:29:11.291 --> 00:29:14.841
<v Chas Fisher>I'm a strong advocate of do whatever works for you.

00:29:14.851 --> 00:29:20.651
<v Chas Fisher>I've just started listening to Cargill, who's the writing partner of Scott Derrickson.

00:29:20.651 --> 00:29:25.571
<v Chas Fisher>And so they wrote Sinister and Doctor Strange together, he's got a podcast called right along,

00:29:26.391 --> 00:29:36.641
<v Chas Fisher>and one of the very first episodes was just His advice was about set manageable goals, even if it's only write a paragraph a day.

00:29:36.641 --> 00:29:49.931
<v Chas Fisher>Set a goal, a daily goal that you know you can hit so that you're not setting yourself up for failure and you'LL eventually get that because there's a big difference. I think we've spoken about this on different backmatter episodes.

00:29:50.091 --> 00:30:05.001
<v Chas Fisher>I think there's a big difference between how you approach your writing your scripts as a process as a craft are into process, and then how you manage time, procrastination, discipline, like all those idiosyncrasies of your own personality.

00:30:05.333 --> 00:30:16.943
<v Stu Willis>Yeah, and we're pretty different in that regard. Only Yang Teo Yang. Yeah, when I'm focused, I'll produce material. But then I'd be like, I got to do with this other thing. Now let me focus on that.

00:30:09.291 --> 00:30:09.501
<v Chas Fisher>There.

00:30:17.381 --> 00:30:26.581
<v Chas Fisher>One of the funniest experiences was last year when I was rewriting a project with you attached to direct Was you,

00:30:26.911 --> 00:30:34.601
<v Chas Fisher>sitting in the corner while I was doing all this like work and talking out loud, and all you would do is lob in hand grenades.

00:30:34.651 --> 00:30:37.811
<v Chas Fisher>Occasionally, I think you were doing like online grocery shopping,

00:30:39.291 --> 00:30:50.901
<v Chas Fisher>and occasionally you would say, What if we just cut that entire sequence and do this and we would then have to argue about it and it wasn't it was about the process anyway.

00:30:51.120 --> 00:31:00.050
<v Stu Willis>Yes, that's how I roll. So I know you're trying to say how whatever works people, but for people who've never started, they don't know what works for them.

00:31:00.060 --> 00:31:07.300
<v Stu Willis>And I'm just saying This is the advice that I'm now giving people to get them, which is don't don't work linearly.

00:31:07.400 --> 00:31:10.860
<v Stu Willis>You got the idea for a scene, right it down, Put on a palm card.

00:31:10.860 --> 00:31:24.160
<v Stu Willis>You Khun, structure it later because I think people get daunted by the very linear nature off Final draught or fade in and have a baby writer working in script now.

00:31:24.160 --> 00:31:27.630
<v Stu Willis>But it's a hard programme to use in this car's workman.

00:31:27.890 --> 00:31:39.740
<v Stu Willis>They've really like in terms of getting yourself out of your head on DH, letting you think I got this idea over here over here, but rather than you just *** *** all over the page.

00:31:39.940 --> 00:31:50.440
<v Stu Willis>But fundament, like coming back to it, though scene work is what's going to make your writing sing, you know, and that's a hard that a man.

00:31:50.440 --> 00:31:57.810
<v Stu Willis>That's a hard thing, but it's a good, good transition into Beginner's Guide to drive zero maybe.

00:31:58.962 --> 00:32:13.082
<v Chas Fisher>So for those of you who are God, if he if you're turning into us for the first time, this episode haven't help you. So hopefully we've listened to a couple of other episodes and it just sort of hanging in to this one.

00:32:13.262 --> 00:32:25.672
<v Chas Fisher>But we just thought we would Yeah, like our journey through draft zero has been What is our problem with our writing right now?

00:32:25.742 --> 00:32:36.952
<v Chas Fisher>So it's often completely without thought or relevance to the episode before or after, and so has been a very haphazard route on DH.

00:32:37.152 --> 00:32:51.272
<v Chas Fisher>You have very sensibly suggested that we just outline a few off the strongest episodes and grouping them together by the sort of craft area of screenwriting.

00:32:52.062 --> 00:32:53.272
<v Chas Fisher>And so we've done that.

00:32:53.458 --> 00:33:03.938
<v Stu Willis>This will become a Web page. Just to be clear, we'LL do It is a page we'LL create a living document to make it easier for people defined areas of interest.

00:32:54.862 --> 00:32:56.772
<v Chas Fisher>Yes, we will link to it.

00:33:03.948 --> 00:33:09.428
<v Stu Willis>Because obviously now, with fifty six episodes behind this, it's like, Where do I start?

00:33:09.548 --> 00:33:16.648
<v Stu Willis>And the answer is all of it, really? Ultimately, to become a good writer, you just need to know everything.

00:33:11.762 --> 00:33:13.172
<v Chas Fisher>Yeah, yeah.

00:33:16.658 --> 00:33:19.878
<v Stu Willis>And that's hard, right? We're still learning.

00:33:21.158 --> 00:33:27.168
<v Stu Willis>But you can't just go. It's not a like how you put together your key asset. That's not how it works.

00:33:26.662 --> 00:33:35.762
<v Chas Fisher>Yeah. Ondas muchas We broken these things down into sort of group headings like structure, character, scene, work, dialogue.

00:33:36.462 --> 00:33:46.322
<v Chas Fisher>All of these things air interlinked like there's we've got one section called Scene work and another section called Character.

00:33:46.332 --> 00:33:51.382
<v Chas Fisher>And there's two of our favourite episodes which one?

00:33:51.392 --> 00:34:03.062
<v Chas Fisher>That the topic creates better scenes, but it also reveals character, and it becomes like a loop. If you've got really great characters bouncing off each other.

00:34:03.252 --> 00:34:10.732
<v Chas Fisher>Then you're going tohave great scenes, and if you write a really good scene, it will inherently reveal character.

00:34:10.732 --> 00:34:18.572
<v Chas Fisher>So it's not so much a chicken and egg scenario. It's just pointing out that, as you say, yes.

00:34:18.582 --> 00:34:23.952
<v Chas Fisher>And as you said, Syria is kind of like you need to know it all at once.

00:34:24.129 --> 00:34:37.809
<v Stu Willis>So I think what we've decided to do is draft zero tends to ice skate through a whole bunch of topics based on what we've been interested in, that we kind of need to grew wth, um, under kind of like broadly themes.

00:34:37.909 --> 00:34:51.169
<v Stu Willis>So we've created a Web page of, like, a Beginner's Guide of Where You Potentially Khun start to cover some of the main areas and screenwriting. And also we're going to try and update our tagging system to make it easier to go.

00:34:51.289 --> 00:35:00.249
<v Stu Willis>I'm interested in every episode that's about this thing sequences, and there will be a whole bunch of all the episodes related to sequences as good as we can make it.

00:35:00.259 --> 00:35:11.309
<v Stu Willis>But the beginnings guy will be a webpage and hopefully a living document, and it's a good place to start if you don't know where to start. Other than that, one, which is not, is very the best way to experiences.

00:35:13.372 --> 00:35:17.782
<v Chas Fisher>Okay, But it does what this does, is it? Ties is back in a way too.

00:35:18.622 --> 00:35:24.972
<v Chas Fisher>The purpose ofthe draft zero, which is all about craft, right?

00:35:24.972 --> 00:35:31.832
<v Chas Fisher>And we've had some listeners come to us and say All right, you know, you're helping me write better.

00:35:31.832 --> 00:35:45.742
<v Chas Fisher>Seen to helping me write better characters. You're helping me do all these things, But you're not really helping me refine exactly what it is that I want to convey in this particular moment, or even in this whole idea or whole script.

00:35:45.752 --> 00:35:50.122
<v Chas Fisher>And Tio boil that somewhat convoluted sentence down into an idea.

00:35:50.252 --> 00:35:54.682
<v Chas Fisher>What draft zero about is about is how in writing.

00:35:54.872 --> 00:36:06.882
<v Chas Fisher>But what we steer well away from is why Why are we compelled to sit down and slug out through an enormous feature film or a pilot script?

00:36:07.643 --> 00:36:09.853
<v Stu Willis>Okay. That's how you interpret the way. Okay.

00:36:09.172 --> 00:36:12.382
<v Chas Fisher>Yeah, all right. How do you interpret the way?

00:36:13.343 --> 00:36:21.453
<v Stu Willis>Well, why people make the decisions that they make wise. Why should I choose to do this? Why should I choose to do that? Mike, I can't tell you.

00:36:22.673 --> 00:36:29.003
<v Stu Willis>You know, we can't tell you how to achieve the effect. We can't tell you why I choose to achieve that effect.

00:36:30.172 --> 00:36:38.232
<v Chas Fisher>Absolutely. And to me, that boils down to like, even if you're talking on a character or a scene level, the effect that you want tohave on the audience,

00:36:38.772 --> 00:36:50.282
<v Chas Fisher>also comes down to what is essentially it kind of comes down to theme and message that the filmmaker is wanting tohave and wanting to say and community.

00:36:50.743 --> 00:36:57.263
<v Stu Willis>And if you don't know that, then you might struggle. I mean, it's to ultimately, it comes down to this idea.

00:36:57.323 --> 00:37:02.653
<v Stu Willis>I mean, segregated from that because that's the question. But I am going to reframe it as question about aesthetics,

00:37:03.213 --> 00:37:13.403
<v Stu Willis>because I had a friend of mine who's an historian, and he he's got his first kind of like a history book coming out this year.

00:37:13.413 --> 00:37:19.103
<v Stu Willis>Like his phD a Storey and not an armchair historian, I collect things that are old.

00:37:19.943 --> 00:37:24.023
<v Stu Willis>He's a legit historian, and he's got a phD candidate that he's supervising.

00:37:24.023 --> 00:37:36.693
<v Stu Willis>And he's like the thing with history is, it's a literary discipline as agree, like there is a disciplined, like researching history. But the telling of the storey is the art of it.

00:37:36.703 --> 00:37:39.553
<v Stu Willis>He's like, I don't quite know how to teach this guy.

00:37:40.143 --> 00:37:44.703
<v Stu Willis>You know how to be creative, and it's like I don't think you can.

00:37:44.713 --> 00:37:57.613
<v Stu Willis>What we can teach them is a theory of aesthetics that, based in our understanding off narrative, this combination of things produces this outcome right.

00:37:57.623 --> 00:38:02.553
<v Stu Willis>It's like coming back to music. This chord progression produces this sound.

00:38:03.043 --> 00:38:08.383
<v Stu Willis>We can't tell you why to put things in a particular order to create a particular emotion.

00:38:08.561 --> 00:38:20.271
<v Stu Willis>Sometimes people wolf that, which is why people fall back on formulas. That's why music can often form for back before formulaic and particularly during the klaxon and classical periods with like, dances.

00:38:20.471 --> 00:38:25.171
<v Stu Willis>Well, this is a waltz. This is this. This is that because it had its purpose outlined.

00:38:25.311 --> 00:38:37.561
<v Stu Willis>So I think ultimately, that's why I call. What we're doing is narrative aesthetics, because it's a theory for understanding why, why we think stuff looks good, what feeling we think it creates.

00:38:37.641 --> 00:38:41.071
<v Stu Willis>But we can't tell you why you'd want to create that feeling in your audience.

00:38:41.861 --> 00:38:48.801
<v Stu Willis>I think we can't you know that's ultimately you, and you may choose to combine things in terrible combinations.

00:38:49.961 --> 00:38:56.771
<v Stu Willis>Maybe you can teach that stuff, but that's well beyond us. And obviously life certainly teaches people, you know.

00:38:55.986 --> 00:39:06.726
<v Chas Fisher>Yeah, on often I do get a note where, like, people just keep pushing back and back and back on a certain thing that I'm doing. And ultimately, I have to say, that is what I want to do.

00:39:06.936 --> 00:39:13.296
<v Chas Fisher>That is, I want my audience to feel the discomfort that you are feeling right now.

00:39:13.965 --> 00:39:18.055
<v Stu Willis>Okay, I'll make a broader point because I've had this conversation before in the context of music.

00:39:18.065 --> 00:39:25.675
<v Stu Willis>But I think it applies equally to film because they're largely both popular art forms.

00:39:26.155 --> 00:39:32.075
<v Stu Willis>And I mean that not in a derogative sense, but in the sense of their kind of mission, which is the certain music.

00:39:32.085 --> 00:39:40.965
<v Stu Willis>A CZ listens at this podcast of hurting you mention before I tend to listen to stuff. It's pretty dark and pretty heavy, a little bit out there, possibly my music.

00:39:40.975 --> 00:39:50.625
<v Stu Willis>Well, not even possibly my music tastes of certainly more extreme than my film tastes, and they're certain music that I listen to that is not meant to be enjoyed.

00:39:54.665 --> 00:40:00.605
<v Stu Willis>Right. It's the musical equivalent of a Francis Bacon painting is a meant to be pleasant.

00:40:00.955 --> 00:40:04.525
<v Stu Willis>It's meant to make you feel something intimate, you think.

00:40:04.555 --> 00:40:14.135
<v Stu Willis>But being quote on court entertaining, I's not its purpose, and that's OK, and I think sometimes that's okay with films.

00:40:14.135 --> 00:40:26.575
<v Stu Willis>But the problem is that film, largely speaking, is an industry that requires a certain number of people in order toe watching in. Therefore, we'LL get finance blah, blah, blah blood that their underlying element of entertainment is a keeper.

00:40:26.965 --> 00:40:37.175
<v Stu Willis>Economy is a key aspect of it, right? But films don't always have to be entertaining and sewing those moments of like, Maybe some people like watching films that are uncomfortable.

00:40:37.939 --> 00:40:47.709
<v Chas Fisher>Well that their their films have famously r abrasive and aggressive to the audience. Like the ones that I know a lot.

00:40:48.359 --> 00:41:02.009
<v Chas Fisher>I was going to say Requiem for a Dream or Irreversible. Those two films, I think, are masterpieces, but I will only ever want to watch them once that doesn't make for a very good business plan.

00:40:52.865 --> 00:40:53.875
<v Stu Willis>Land have returned.

00:41:01.865 --> 00:41:13.475
<v Stu Willis>No, but in terms of comes to your own writing is I think we're talking about films is the hole. But there's only sequences which gain a lot of power through being unpleasant in the moment.

00:41:14.045 --> 00:41:17.295
<v Stu Willis>I mean, we're recording this on the eve.

00:41:17.305 --> 00:41:20.965
<v Stu Willis>Miles actually come out, but that's pretend it's the IV endgame coming out.

00:41:20.975 --> 00:41:28.085
<v Stu Willis>Thie anticipation wouldn't be so high if they didn't end it in the way that they did, even if we know it's going largely get resolved positively.

00:41:28.445 --> 00:41:36.355
<v Stu Willis>The sense of discomfort or despair that it created the audience created in anticipation. There's a tension there.

00:41:36.545 --> 00:41:50.655
<v Stu Willis>There needs to be resolved, and sometimes the desire to make people people feeling uncomfortable about people feeling uncomfortable is a way to actually remove tension from work and therefore becomes disinterested becomes un interesting.

00:41:51.267 --> 00:41:51.577
<v Chas Fisher>Now.

00:41:51.745 --> 00:41:52.915
<v Stu Willis>Because that's what tension is.

00:41:52.915 --> 00:42:04.955
<v Stu Willis>That unbearable sense of like I'm waiting for this to get resolved is either gonna be horrible or pleasant, you know, which is a kind of another fundamental riding principle. It's hard to articulate, but no tension.

00:42:05.975 --> 00:42:10.215
<v Stu Willis>There's contrast in there's tension, you know, that's even more than a midpoint.

00:42:10.465 --> 00:42:16.055
<v Stu Willis>The fundamental of a lot of what we have to do is to do with creating creation of tension. The unanswered question.

00:42:16.645 --> 00:42:21.355
<v Stu Willis>You know, that was a sick way for you to talk about questions, but.

00:42:21.432 --> 00:42:24.812
<v Chas Fisher>Well, thank you for explaining my Segway.

00:42:25.342 --> 00:42:35.952
<v Chas Fisher>Yeah, I think this is probably stating the obvious, but I've just come to a broader understanding off all of the aesthetics,

00:42:35.992 --> 00:42:45.102
<v Chas Fisher>boils down to in terms of is particularly true of screenwriting, but is possibly true of any kind of narrative based art form,

00:42:45.532 --> 00:42:53.292
<v Chas Fisher>where you don't want an absence of questions from an audience like If there's if they're not asking any questions, then they're not engaged.

00:42:53.292 --> 00:42:57.242
<v Chas Fisher>They're not leaning forward. They're not wondering. They're not curious.

00:42:57.732 --> 00:43:07.342
<v Chas Fisher>So you want questions from the audience. But more and more come to the feeling that all of these craft tools boiled down to in this moment,

00:43:07.932 --> 00:43:20.542
<v Chas Fisher>what exactly do I want my own, my audience members to be feeling thinking or asking and setting up my film accordingly on?

00:43:20.542 --> 00:43:30.322
<v Chas Fisher>I don't know if I have much more to say about it, other than I think moving forward with draft zero, it's going to be like their underlying questions that I'm going to be,

00:43:30.602 --> 00:43:36.142
<v Chas Fisher>asking not of my own work and also of the different topics in areas that were attacked.

00:43:36.613 --> 00:43:40.133
<v Stu Willis>In what way is asking separate from their thinking.

00:43:40.523 --> 00:43:47.393
<v Stu Willis>Feeling I understand is something that can exist in the moment. I am happy. I'm sad. It's a particular scared.

00:43:43.732 --> 00:43:45.642
<v Chas Fisher>Yeah, scared?

00:43:47.403 --> 00:43:53.313
<v Stu Willis>But what is what separates thinking from questions? I guess it's kind of talk about the favourite.

00:43:53.323 --> 00:44:04.233
<v Stu Willis>I guess maybe it's that sense of like you're contemplating its or thematic sequences, you contemplating it, meaning separate from what happens next.

00:43:53.712 --> 00:43:54.142
<v Chas Fisher>Yeah.

00:44:01.532 --> 00:44:08.342
<v Chas Fisher>Yeah, but I suppose is e guess as soon as you're contemplating. Maybe you are asking questions.

00:44:08.693 --> 00:44:14.533
<v Stu Willis>You ask questions in different way. It's a question that's different from what happens next becomes a question of what does this mean?

00:44:14.593 --> 00:44:18.633
<v Stu Willis>How do I feel? What does this mean? What happens next to kind of the fundamental quest?

00:44:18.532 --> 00:44:21.632
<v Chas Fisher>But even that is mastery from a craft perspective.

00:44:21.647 --> 00:44:25.997
<v Chas Fisher>This I have decided that at this moment, and we looked at this a lot in the,

00:44:26.427 --> 00:44:31.397
<v Chas Fisher>in the antagonistic Siri's, particularly versus audience is when,

00:44:31.787 --> 00:44:45.697
<v Chas Fisher>you know it can be in control off the filmmaker to say at this point, I'm going toe order my narrative so that my audience sits back and actually thinks about something separate to what they're actually seeing right now.

00:44:45.984 --> 00:44:55.934
<v Stu Willis>Interesting that you've gone in that direction when I've kind of doubled down on the simplicity of for dry, manic Sam.

00:44:56.624 --> 00:45:03.544
<v Stu Willis>I think your questions not wrong. I think they're good, but they're kind of like one step removed From what?

00:45:03.554 --> 00:45:10.284
<v Stu Willis>When you're working in broadly speaking the mode of drama of what to these characters want, Why can't they get it? Why now?

00:45:10.664 --> 00:45:19.034
<v Stu Willis>Because I think often those three basic questions of why are scenes are not working and that stops people from asking from feeling, thinking or question.

00:45:19.354 --> 00:45:22.964
<v Chas Fisher>Yeah, and maybe it's it's cart before the horse.

00:45:23.454 --> 00:45:36.564
<v Chas Fisher>But I often think that if unaudited in CE is wondering what's happening next, depending on the question that the audience is asking, you can get away with a lot on a micro level.

00:45:38.244 --> 00:45:41.664
<v Stu Willis>Okay, I'm going way. We're getting into a little bit of debate, which is good.

00:45:42.034 --> 00:45:46.834
<v Stu Willis>I think the difference is what you're talking about. Analytical tools and what I'm talking about, a creative tools,

00:45:47.324 --> 00:45:57.264
<v Stu Willis>because I think coming back to my observation about intent versus execution, your stuffs about intent and there's a lot of people go Well, this is what I want the audience to feel.

00:45:57.264 --> 00:46:01.764
<v Stu Willis>This is what I want them to think. This is what I want them tow you, no question.

00:46:02.224 --> 00:46:07.034
<v Stu Willis>But there's no ability for them to actually determine whether or not that is happening in their material.

00:46:07.424 --> 00:46:16.334
<v Stu Willis>You could easily say that well, this is what I want them to build in this scene with having no comprehension, that your scene is failing to do that.

00:46:18.123 --> 00:46:27.963
<v Chas Fisher>Yeah, sure, Andi. Only way I get that insight. You know, saying what I said before is actually through feedback because I haven't written it to not achieve my intent, you know?

00:46:28.303 --> 00:46:39.873
<v Chas Fisher>So it's only when I get consistent feedback saying this is not what I'm thinking or not what I'm feeling that I then go, Well, where have I stepped wrong that you're thinking about it.

00:46:39.873 --> 00:46:45.053
<v Chas Fisher>And often the problem is, actually, they're asking a question that I should have removed from the equation.

00:46:45.463 --> 00:46:48.233
<v Chas Fisher>They're asking something that I should have answered earlier.

00:46:48.723 --> 00:46:55.103
<v Chas Fisher>And I think we're going to get into this a lot in our next episode, which is going to be looking at exposition in,

00:46:55.463 --> 00:47:08.733
<v Chas Fisher>the later season, Season seven and season eight of Game of Thrones because they are masters at or they've got the luxury of being in such control over,

00:47:09.083 --> 00:47:12.103
<v Chas Fisher>the questions that the audiences asking.

00:47:12.403 --> 00:47:25.133
<v Chas Fisher>But I think you're right. I am very much thinking analytically rather than generative Lee and, you know, maybe that's a floor of mine, but I don't know. I feel that the generation is not something that I think about that often.

00:47:25.369 --> 00:47:32.969
<v Stu Willis>Yeah, maybe you should, like fundamentally, No one's going to look atyour piece of writing.

00:47:32.979 --> 00:47:41.879
<v Stu Willis>I mean, I know we're actually this is perfect backmatter People are not going to look a particular scene on like Okay, I'll rephrase.

00:47:42.029 --> 00:47:53.889
<v Stu Willis>They will. They'll understand This's what I feel. This is what I expect to feel right like And the thing is, audience feelings or thinking's about when people say this is how I feel. I think they're not wrong.

00:47:53.999 --> 00:47:58.109
<v Stu Willis>You can't argue with how your material made someone react, right?

00:47:58.249 --> 00:48:03.059
<v Stu Willis>The question for you is the rider is Is that okay?

00:48:03.069 --> 00:48:06.509
<v Stu Willis>Is this okay for them to feel that way you might antagonise,

00:48:06.719 --> 00:48:21.209
<v Stu Willis>that person may not like your material, and that's okay because it's not for them its the wrong junk or or whatever, but often to fix that you're not going to necessarily You're going to be going and changing the feeling over thinking,

00:48:21.569 --> 00:48:25.379
<v Stu Willis>all the next questioning you're going to be relying on,

00:48:25.969 --> 00:48:31.049
<v Stu Willis>those things are consequences off the underlying dramatic writing, right.

00:48:31.059 --> 00:48:45.959
<v Stu Willis>And so you can only operate and ask those things of yourself. If your dramatic writing is so good and not yours, yours is yet jazz for that to just be a AM complete mastery of my craft that I can make people feel and think and question, however I want them to.

00:48:45.776 --> 00:48:51.106
<v Chas Fisher>Please, listeners. Rest assured, I do not feel that I have achieved this level.

00:48:51.116 --> 00:48:56.496
<v Chas Fisher>It is Mohr, I guess, conceptually for me. Like what is the purpose?

00:48:56.726 --> 00:49:11.306
<v Chas Fisher>The underlying purpose of storytelling on both the macron, a micro level and how do identify whether my writing is working for me is if someone's asking a question at a point where I want them.

00:49:11.306 --> 00:49:15.146
<v Chas Fisher>Tio, either not be asking questions are asking a different question or feeling something.

00:49:15.336 --> 00:49:17.826
<v Chas Fisher>Then it's something's gone wrong.

00:49:18.570 --> 00:49:25.770
<v Stu Willis>There's a quote from Tom Stoppard's The Rial Thing, Then I'm going to read, which is about a cricket bat. But I read the whole quote.

00:49:26.030 --> 00:49:28.730
<v Stu Willis>I saw Hugo Weaving performed there, so imagine I'm Hugo Weaving.

00:49:29.970 --> 00:49:38.150
<v Stu Willis>The thing here, which walks like a wooden club, is actually several pieces off particular would commonly put together in a certain way.

00:49:38.190 --> 00:49:43.700
<v Stu Willis>So the whole thing is sprung like a dance, for it's for heating cricket bats with to get it right.

00:49:43.830 --> 00:49:50.570
<v Stu Willis>The cricket ball will travel two hundred yards in four seconds, and all you've done is give it a knock, like knocking the top off a bottle of stout.

00:49:50.870 --> 00:49:53.310
<v Stu Willis>And it makes a noise like a trout taking a fly.

00:49:53.770 --> 00:49:59.570
<v Stu Willis>What we're trying to do is write cricket bats so that we throw up in idea and give it in a little knock.

00:49:59.580 --> 00:50:14.410
<v Stu Willis>It might travel right, and for May I boil this down to the job of articulation on what we're talking about in terms of dramatic drama is articulation is we make things aerodynamic right.

00:50:14.460 --> 00:50:17.800
<v Stu Willis>The better our riding, the more aerodynamic our ideas are.

00:50:18.000 --> 00:50:23.120
<v Stu Willis>And those ideas could be about character. That could be about theme that Khun b about plot that could be anything.

00:50:23.120 --> 00:50:36.200
<v Stu Willis>And our abilities to make it aerodynamic and draft zero is about Maybe if you look at this little foil and we kind of like Ben bend the wing this sort of way that maybe that idea just travels that little bit further, right?

00:50:36.500 --> 00:50:44.050
<v Stu Willis>And so, for may, it's like, Is it useful, like, obviously going to be sitting there? Well, where do you want to place the cricket ball?

00:50:44.220 --> 00:50:52.080
<v Stu Willis>It's like, Well, once you can place the *** heat is six. It doesn't really matter where you want to *** put the cricket ball. You gotta learn how to hit the six in the first place.

00:50:52.164 --> 00:50:58.084
<v Chas Fisher>For anyone who's a cricket fan out there. I sincerely apologise for Soos ham fisted analogy here.

00:50:58.470 --> 00:51:06.280
<v Stu Willis>Okay? Okay. Yes. You always want to pull it out. You want to pull that sheet, You're six. That you're *** leg stump.

00:51:08.470 --> 00:51:10.280
<v Stu Willis>Short meeting. Silly mid on. No, no, no.

00:51:10.764 --> 00:51:14.664
<v Chas Fisher>Okay, I think I've mentioned this in previous backmatter Sze A cz well is.

00:51:14.664 --> 00:51:26.004
<v Chas Fisher>When I went to all that effort of writing that first script, you then gave me devastating feedback, like really devastating feedback.

00:51:26.004 --> 00:51:32.274
<v Chas Fisher>I'm sure if I search my e mails, I could find it somewhere, which was basically that my first group was a steaming pile of ***.

00:51:34.164 --> 00:51:42.864
<v Chas Fisher>And, you know, you give me feedback for working on it, but as crippling as it was, you then sent me the David Foster Wallace.

00:51:44.340 --> 00:51:45.110
<v Stu Willis>This is what.

00:51:46.088 --> 00:51:51.568
<v Excerpts>There are these two young fish swimming along, and they happen to meet an older fish swimming the other way.

00:51:51.578 --> 00:51:55.048
<v Excerpts>Who nods at them and says, Morning, boys, how's the water?

00:51:56.118 --> 00:52:02.448
<v Excerpts>And the two young fish swim on for a bit, and then eventually one of them looks over at the other and goes, What the hell is water?

00:52:05.038 --> 00:52:11.248
<v Excerpts>This is a standard requirement of US commencement speeches, the deployment of the tactic, little parable ish storeys.

00:52:12.738 --> 00:52:27.548
<v Excerpts>The Storey thing turns out to be one of the better, less bullish, any conventions of the genre. But if you're worried that I plan to present myself, here is the wise older fish explaining what water is to you. Younger fish. Please don't be. I am not the wise old fish.

00:52:28.538 --> 00:52:34.848
<v Excerpts>The point of the fish storey is merely that. The most obvious important realities are often the ones that are hardest to see and talk about.

00:52:35.258 --> 00:52:42.698
<v Chas Fisher>And that actual that accept help me keep writing after having spent all this time and effort writing a steaming pile.

00:52:42.698 --> 00:52:56.608
<v Chas Fisher>Sh was the idea that by writing that first awful draught, I was now waken Teo a whole new realm of possibilities, and here we are five years later.

00:52:58.216 --> 00:53:04.136
<v Stu Willis>Still exploring the whole new realm of possibilities throughout stinking piles of ***.

00:53:05.576 --> 00:53:19.786
<v Stu Willis>It's they still sneak. The diet may have changed, but they still think I'm laughing. I I don't know if there's a lesson we Khun draw from that. Maybe I can try.

00:53:21.546 --> 00:53:26.786
<v Stu Willis>I guess what I'm trying to do is reiterate the utility off.

00:53:27.476 --> 00:53:32.646
<v Stu Willis>Not just over draft zero of focusing on the craft to pick eight. I don't actually give a ***.

00:53:32.866 --> 00:53:35.616
<v Stu Willis>Honestly, I don't I don't give a *** about your ideas.

00:53:35.986 --> 00:53:45.836
<v Stu Willis>If you cann't articulate them, right, a very practical level, you can have the greatest idea, right? And this is a problem, right?

00:53:46.006 --> 00:53:52.486
<v Stu Willis>So I'm going to rephrase this because I think there is a correlation between people assuming the people who can speak and write well have good ideas.

00:53:53.076 --> 00:53:56.366
<v Stu Willis>And this's gonna be so controversial. And I want to drop the hand grenade.

00:53:56.606 --> 00:54:08.486
<v Stu Willis>Someone like Dr Jordan Peterson shows the danger of that where she'd ideas dressed up in beautiful language mixed in with good ideas can confuse people. And they think because they're well articulated that they're good ideas, right?

00:54:09.176 --> 00:54:14.226
<v Stu Willis>Because we've got the inverse of that. I just said that to trigger a whole bunch of people.

00:54:14.976 --> 00:54:16.356
<v Stu Willis>It's also true, ten percent on sense.

00:54:17.776 --> 00:54:25.086
<v Stu Willis>The inverse of that is we also maybe assumption that people that Kontic yah late ideas are idiots. And that is not necessarily true.

00:54:25.476 --> 00:54:34.626
<v Stu Willis>Both because you and I have studied law. We actually know the ability to argue an idea Well, does not actually mean that the idea is any good, right?

00:54:34.626 --> 00:54:42.886
<v Stu Willis>That's the whole point of law is that you argue bad ideas? Well, you just don't know what whether yours idea is the god of the bad one.

00:54:43.376 --> 00:54:52.196
<v Stu Willis>But when you're talking about riding on a professional level, your job is to articulate, you know, to make it understood it doesn't.

00:54:52.206 --> 00:54:55.736
<v Stu Willis>Actually, your intent will either be yours or will be someone else's.

00:54:55.736 --> 00:55:10.704
<v Stu Willis>It's going to be someone else going. This is what I want. I want toe horror film under one hundred pages that we can make for five hundred thousand dollars. It's got this cast and it's got this feel and you, as professional writer, have to articulate and execute that right?

00:55:11.294 --> 00:55:25.924
<v Stu Willis>A ll The Esa Terry Thinking about running is you want to use that to inform your writing, But what is going to get your hide is your ability to execute because often in a professional setting other people that are telling you where you're going you're going toe shoot your six.

00:55:25.984 --> 00:55:31.404
<v Stu Willis>Where you going? Toe Kick you where you're going to kick your home Goal. I don't know. I'm trying to think.

00:55:31.564 --> 00:55:37.074
<v Chas Fisher>Stewart actually enjoy sport a lot more than he is lying about right now.

00:55:37.294 --> 00:55:40.504
<v Stu Willis>I'm deliberately mixing my metaphors.

00:55:40.774 --> 00:55:44.074
<v Chas Fisher>Yeah, I Look, I think this is hopefully men.

00:55:44.614 --> 00:55:50.474
<v Chas Fisher>A somewhat interesting discussion for our listeners about approach on DH.

00:55:50.864 --> 00:55:59.234
<v Chas Fisher>You know, a lot of screenwriting is is problem solving like so often I'm like, I know what the idea That I want the scene. Tio do.

00:55:59.244 --> 00:56:05.974
<v Chas Fisher>And I could just have two characters arguing that but that's often the most boring and obvious route.

00:56:05.984 --> 00:56:17.964
<v Chas Fisher>And then the troubling things How doe eyed dramatise thiss How do I turn this conflict that I want to thematically talk about into a narrative?

00:56:18.475 --> 00:56:27.605
<v Stu Willis>Because you just had to spend some time in the Facebook streamlining group. There's a lot of people with hard, fast ideas about what they want to do. That's not what makes you valuable right.

00:56:28.374 --> 00:56:32.184
<v Chas Fisher>Well, talking about value.

00:56:31.735 --> 00:56:32.215
<v Stu Willis>Faster.

00:56:32.774 --> 00:56:45.684
<v Chas Fisher>I think that I'm gonna latch onto that light to guide us out of this dark cave of abstract conversation into a discussion about having your work produced.

00:56:46.074 --> 00:56:59.514
<v Chas Fisher>Because director bought me an amazing idea and he is a writer director, and he could have written it himself, but brought it to me to write it quicker on DH.

00:56:59.544 --> 00:57:10.354
<v Chas Fisher>Hopefully better in collaboration, and we did, and we wrote a short and we're really excited about, and it's starting to get into some festivals on.

00:57:10.354 --> 00:57:23.204
<v Chas Fisher>We're really happy about it, but so no, but I won't start with the, but I'm going to start with the encourage any aspiring writers out there to try and talk Teo directors.

00:57:23.204 --> 00:57:33.284
<v Chas Fisher>And there's there's something about getting your work produced that is like, That's the point of Thiss, isn't it? And writing all the scripts in the world that never getting them produced is not the point.

00:57:33.574 --> 00:57:39.614
<v Chas Fisher>And there's so many things to learn from having your work produce. And there's lots of people who can talk to this.

00:57:39.624 --> 00:57:43.894
<v Chas Fisher>But I don't want to talk about having my work produced a tte this point.

00:57:44.104 --> 00:57:48.484
<v Chas Fisher>I do want to talk about what your expectations should be.

00:57:48.874 --> 00:57:59.484
<v Chas Fisher>Going into that kind of collaboration at this kind of career stage that I'm at on DH, what has been my experience coming out of it being produced.

00:57:59.494 --> 00:58:01.964
<v Chas Fisher>So the idea was his.

00:58:01.974 --> 00:58:06.724
<v Chas Fisher>The directors on DH, I wrote it, So I have copyrighted the script.

00:58:06.734 --> 00:58:12.904
<v Chas Fisher>He then produced it self financed it, which is amazing honour and privilege.

00:58:13.624 --> 00:58:18.174
<v Chas Fisher>While I wrote it, he had a massive hand in the development.

00:58:18.184 --> 00:58:30.914
<v Chas Fisher>You know, Tio end up with a sixteen page script. It took us a year back and forth between myself and the director, but we both went into it knowing that there was a feature in this idea.

00:58:31.604 --> 00:58:41.114
<v Chas Fisher>And the reason why I contributed my services for nothing as a rider was to have an opportunity,

00:58:41.604 --> 00:58:47.364
<v Chas Fisher>to have a produce piece of work, which was essentially a proof of concept for a feature that I would then be able to write,

00:58:48.004 --> 00:58:50.904
<v Chas Fisher>Andi on. It's the same for him.

00:58:50.914 --> 00:59:00.444
<v Chas Fisher>He would have a proof of concept on DH, a pitch for a feature that we could then get, you know, commercial interests in and go forth and be produced.

00:59:01.244 --> 00:59:11.754
<v Chas Fisher>Which is fantastic, and we had these expectations down in writing going into it, which I strongly recommend Anyone do, like, get something in writing.

00:59:11.754 --> 00:59:15.444
<v Chas Fisher>It doesn't have to be a legally binding document. Doesn't have to be an option agreement.

00:59:15.454 --> 00:59:19.634
<v Chas Fisher>All those things would be good. But get something in writing as to what you believe.

00:59:19.634 --> 00:59:30.514
<v Chas Fisher>Your rights and expectations are moving forward where it's been really difficult. Coming out of this process is that the script has been a success.

00:59:32.604 --> 00:59:34.114
<v Chas Fisher>A cz muchas a short.

00:59:35.140 --> 00:59:38.840
<v Chas Fisher>You know a short romcom about vasectomies can ever, ever be.

00:59:40.090 --> 00:59:48.830
<v Chas Fisher>But just the heartache off getting a feature project up, especially in Australia.

00:59:48.840 --> 01:00:00.250
<v Chas Fisher>But I imagine this is the same. Everywhere is lots of people want to buy a concept on by a proven idea on DH,

01:00:00.840 --> 01:00:12.430
<v Chas Fisher>there's a There's a much bigger market for buying a concept than there is for funding a feature film on What do I mean by this distinction is that,

01:00:12.880 --> 01:00:17.850
<v Chas Fisher>there would be a lot more opportunities for him and I to sell,

01:00:18.740 --> 01:00:20.750
<v Chas Fisher>the idea that we've got,

01:00:21.740 --> 01:00:28.190
<v Chas Fisher>or even write up a pitch and sell the pitch or even get to the point of writing up the script and selling the script.

01:00:29.040 --> 01:00:34.650
<v Chas Fisher>But that's not why he has invested his time and money. He wants his.

01:00:35.540 --> 01:00:47.060
<v Chas Fisher>You know, this to be a leg towards his first feature film, or his first directing gig on a TV Siri's or something like that on one of the things that I didn't realise is that coming into this,

01:00:47.790 --> 01:00:54.780
<v Chas Fisher>coming out of it, even though we both want to make this project and we both want to make it together, we've got very different career incentives,

01:00:55.640 --> 01:00:58.610
<v Chas Fisher>and Korean needs as a screenwriter and as a director.

01:00:58.888 --> 01:01:05.058
<v Stu Willis>Comparing it with my experience is I've never written a short film that's been directed by someone else.

01:01:05.488 --> 01:01:09.458
<v Stu Willis>I've directed scripts that have been written by someone else,

01:01:10.288 --> 01:01:24.608
<v Stu Willis>but the scripts that I've written that to be directed by someone else one of those was I was originally intending to direct, and it became clear that we couldn't get the financing with me attached, so I decided.

01:01:23.240 --> 01:01:28.550
<v Chas Fisher>Not because of you in particular, but you as a first time director. Okay.

01:01:27.810 --> 01:01:38.800
<v Stu Willis>Both. Ultimately, which is what makes directing so *** hard compared to riding, I think because riding they'LL take it.

01:01:38.800 --> 01:01:47.820
<v Stu Willis>Sze a lot lower risk to hire first time writers, and they can always get you rewritten, you know, But they're not going to go. Let's get a first time director I'm born and getting redirected.

01:01:47.320 --> 01:01:47.730
<v Chas Fisher>It's.

01:01:50.510 --> 01:01:56.420
<v Stu Willis>By someone we can trust. That's getting to direct this from the chief and then we'LL redirect, get redirected later.

01:01:57.210 --> 01:02:10.700
<v Stu Willis>I mean, that kind of happens in direct ways. There's definitely a lot of storeys when you scratch under the surface of like editors shooting reshoots after the director's not being invited back after they've had in the director's card and all that stuff.

01:02:10.710 --> 01:02:16.420
<v Stu Willis>But they're all, like, actual, honest to God, Hollywood storeys that no one really tells about in the press circuit.

01:02:16.870 --> 01:02:27.040
<v Stu Willis>So but I think moving forward in all cases, there is definitely a reason tohave agreements in some way.

01:02:27.040 --> 01:02:33.660
<v Stu Willis>I think that's important may. Having myself, I just treat for me, riding is a lot less emotional than directing.

01:02:33.670 --> 01:02:42.000
<v Stu Willis>I think for other people, it's the opposite that some of them find, like directing a real craft, and they found writing really personal. For me, it's complete. Opposite.

01:02:42.010 --> 01:02:48.340
<v Stu Willis>Directing is very emotional on DH draining where is riding on community yet they could do that.

01:02:48.780 --> 01:02:54.920
<v Stu Willis>What do you want? And I'm not saying I'm doing a good job of it, but I can kind of take in a non personal way.

01:02:55.810 --> 01:03:03.750
<v Stu Willis>But I think in terms of projects, ultimately you're talking about the creation of intellectual property, which has value, and deciding how.

01:03:04.650 --> 01:03:13.120
<v Stu Willis>That project will move forward with the understanding that they can become a situation where one on two people are decreasing the value.

01:03:13.120 --> 01:03:24.450
<v Stu Willis>I'm not saying this is specifically you, like in your situation, but I'm talking in the abstract. Khun Devalue a project right so that it's working out. What is your exit strategy?

01:03:24.670 --> 01:03:27.600
<v Stu Willis>Is there an exit strategy? Because someone can come on board and go?

01:03:27.923 --> 01:03:32.813
<v Stu Willis>And I've heard projects now given the current climate, and I'm not trying to make a political comment.

01:03:32.813 --> 01:03:40.833
<v Stu Willis>But what's like Juma? All writers writing script, predominantly female casts and a funding body, government or private is gone.

01:03:40.833 --> 01:03:50.393
<v Stu Willis>We think we need to female voice obvious in order to move to the next stage. So we are stepping you aside for you to move forward, we need to step you aside and then put a female voice.

01:03:50.403 --> 01:03:59.363
<v Stu Willis>Thing is a writer. That's probably a lot easier to deal with because there are traditions and processes for managing credit arbitration.

01:03:59.853 --> 01:04:03.863
<v Stu Willis>Where is with directing? It's like you could be. You could do a lot of developmental script,

01:04:04.553 --> 01:04:15.793
<v Stu Willis>and not contribute a word and no longer be involved in the project and get and not shoot anything so you don't even get an executive producer credit.

01:04:15.793 --> 01:04:26.263
<v Stu Willis>So, you know, in this state, I would say, If you're a director, I would say approach material developing as a producer like option material.

01:04:24.050 --> 01:04:25.070
<v Chas Fisher>Yeah.

01:04:26.853 --> 01:04:39.543
<v Stu Willis>This is This is what I would say for those of us amongst the directors is if you are working with a writer on developing natural option it, and that means that you have got proximity not just China tile, but your proximity.

01:04:39.663 --> 01:04:52.273
<v Stu Willis>So then you khun someone else. You might then in your option agreement, have the ability to sell the option agreement on or injury genuine partnerships, or even if you no longer director, that you're in a position of being a producer.

01:04:52.283 --> 01:04:56.663
<v Stu Willis>Whereas I think writers because fundamentally, they contribute to the regiment era a literate, more protected.

01:04:57.053 --> 01:05:09.213
<v Stu Willis>But that protection also makes complication is if there is a tiff between the writers or if produced, just say, someone comes along and goes, There's two of you you know, I more than a paper team.

01:05:09.223 --> 01:05:14.203
<v Stu Willis>But you're not necessarily like Boff riding buddies wearily right together.

01:05:14.213 --> 01:05:18.553
<v Stu Willis>You know there's a spectrum between where any running as a team because someone told us to end.

01:05:18.563 --> 01:05:26.793
<v Stu Willis>When the ever write together, there's actually a whole I think for a lot of writing partnerships arisen in between that someone comes along and goes, for whatever reason, we,

01:05:28.047 --> 01:05:35.957
<v Stu Willis>like this writer more than you, or we're going to put a female writer, but we want them to write with one, haven't understanding of how that's going to work and trying to put a value on that.

01:05:37.167 --> 01:05:41.287
<v Stu Willis>It's a complicated thing, but you need Teo. Have, as you say, something written down.

01:05:41.297 --> 01:05:53.657
<v Stu Willis>It doesn't have to be a full deal memo because ultimately it's just a written intention as both of us being ways you an actual practising lawyer all know ridden intention will be used to inform any decision.

01:05:54.302 --> 01:05:58.242
<v Chas Fisher>Well, just coming out of this, like, obviously, that's the key lesson.

01:05:58.252 --> 01:06:01.742
<v Chas Fisher>Get your intentions written up somewhere, even if it's just in une male.

01:06:01.752 --> 01:06:12.152
<v Chas Fisher>But the if you are in the position that I was where you're an emerging and aspiring writer and you are writing for a director,

01:06:12.802 --> 01:06:18.182
<v Chas Fisher>even when the collaboration is great and even when you want to work together on the project moving forward,

01:06:18.742 --> 01:06:27.182
<v Chas Fisher>I think what I've come to the understanding ofthe is moving forward that it has to be the director's project as muchas.

01:06:27.192 --> 01:06:33.142
<v Chas Fisher>I value my input and, you know, I'm not trying to undermine it.

01:06:33.622 --> 01:06:42.612
<v Chas Fisher>It's just that it's harder for a director to get across the line, particularly first time director, than it is for a writer.

01:06:42.992 --> 01:06:50.112
<v Chas Fisher>And as a result, if you're doing anything where you're together, it's going to be getting the director across the line.

01:06:50.502 --> 01:06:57.842
<v Chas Fisher>And so that's my key lesson walking into this and to be clear, I would do it again, and I have zero regrets.

01:06:57.852 --> 01:07:06.572
<v Chas Fisher>This guy didn't amazing job. He took my work. He had faith with me in me. He spent a good chunk of his life arguing with me.

01:07:10.002 --> 01:07:13.352
<v Chas Fisher>On on DH.

01:07:13.412 --> 01:07:18.982
<v Chas Fisher>I'm so proud of what came out of it. You know, it's the first time I've had work produced. Well, I haven't produced it.

01:07:18.992 --> 01:07:23.322
<v Chas Fisher>And it's such an honour, and I'm so excited tohave it out there in the world.

01:07:23.622 --> 01:07:28.392
<v Chas Fisher>And you know, we are having meetings off the back of it. We are pitching it.

01:07:28.402 --> 01:07:39.012
<v Chas Fisher>It's just a very quickly realised that it's It's no, it's not my baby to pitch like I'm there to service the director getting this job. Yes.

01:07:37.997 --> 01:07:47.267
<v Stu Willis>In this situation and weren't necessarily there has been cases of short films like Sync.

01:07:47.267 --> 01:07:53.807
<v Stu Willis>Sling Blade ended up being directed by someone who I think I believe all the thought in directed. And he didn't direct the short.

01:07:54.717 --> 01:07:58.007
<v Stu Willis>There have been situations where the writing has been more important than than directing.

01:07:58.217 --> 01:08:10.667
<v Chas Fisher>Absolutely. But I guess at some point either there was either the writer was a producer on that or had chain of title or the director of the underlying material was poured out at some point.

01:08:10.697 --> 01:08:20.907
<v Stu Willis>Yeah, well, yes and no. I mean, it could just be there was a case with a black Mirror episode where the rider, because thie original BBC version the writing fees were so low,

01:08:21.397 --> 01:08:31.407
<v Stu Willis>the kind of they're not residual kind of whatever reserve rights to do with, like adaptations and stuff were kept with the writers with this one particular right up.

01:08:32.297 --> 01:08:45.947
<v Stu Willis>So, in other words, the writing agreement on this particular episode of BlackBerry company, which one meant that they had the right to produce the film and exclusivity over television adaptations but not feature films.

01:08:46.047 --> 01:08:51.107
<v Stu Willis>So the writer Reese turned it into a feature film and then sold the feature script.

01:08:51.117 --> 01:08:57.307
<v Stu Willis>There are ways that you could do that as a writer, and so with restoration, and I'm still working with that producer.

01:08:57.307 --> 01:09:11.817
<v Stu Willis>But part of our agreement wass that the right to produce restoration was non exclusive, both in terms ofthe derivative material, so it would be derivative rights, both in terms of the derivative rights and remake rights.

01:09:11.817 --> 01:09:17.057
<v Stu Willis>So with restoration, we could have sold the script to someone else to remake. Or we could have.

01:09:18.797 --> 01:09:27.007
<v Stu Willis>We could have sold the derivative, like so the feet that feature or a television series or a stage play or musical or a comic book or whatever.

01:09:27.097 --> 01:09:38.912
<v Stu Willis>And so that can be something that if you were working on a short film level, that you can think about doing that. You can say I'm gonna let you produce this and you've got the right to produce the short film. But it's only exclusive, Desperate to be of short.

01:09:39.394 --> 01:09:52.264
<v Chas Fisher>And that is a reflection off you having expressed your intention and having that captured in writing, in fact, contractually, But, you know, before going too far down the road.

01:09:54.102 --> 01:10:02.212
<v Stu Willis>Kind of helps when the producer the time has a lawyer and I got a little background and they now have a lawyer, so it kind of,

01:10:03.102 --> 01:10:16.572
<v Stu Willis>yeah, yeah, But I think it sze making sure that you understand the intent but also understand the possibilities of intent, Which is why I'm talking about derivative rights because I think it's probably something that emerging right screenwriting probably don't even know where is not like that.

01:10:16.572 --> 01:10:19.012
<v Stu Willis>You can carve out separately, right?

01:10:20.801 --> 01:10:34.051
<v Stu Willis>And I'm in the process of negotiating an option on a short storey and derivative rights on the short storey is something that is part of our option, because we may be able to get a cheaper option if our put a purchase price.

01:10:34.062 --> 01:10:43.312
<v Stu Willis>If our purchase price option doesn't include the TV Siri's, for example, or, you know we have to be very clear about what areas of exclusivity were taking.

01:10:43.352 --> 01:10:55.132
<v Stu Willis>But I think that's a good option for a feature film for a short film. Sorry if they're you're running a short for a director, but your specific instances different cause it's the directors idea and he had reading material of speaking to it.

01:10:55.322 --> 01:10:58.642
<v Stu Willis>So he's at least got a night idea in a fixed form.

01:11:00.402 --> 01:11:05.212
<v Stu Willis>God, we just turned into an episode of script notes for a brief moment. I'm bred.

01:11:05.788 --> 01:11:11.918
<v Chas Fisher>Well, no, no umbrage, no umbrage. It'Ll It's Maur. Hey!

01:11:09.402 --> 01:11:14.422
<v Stu Willis>I'm Craig means that I'm the Craig Mason. If draft zero everyone *** knows that the other road.

01:11:15.988 --> 01:11:29.468
<v Chas Fisher>Ah! So I've only got one final topic to cover in this backmatter episode, which is broadly under the topic off Forgiving yourself for not writing.

01:11:29.758 --> 01:11:35.408
<v Chas Fisher>So I am considered within my circle of writing friends,

01:11:35.658 --> 01:11:49.268
<v Chas Fisher>fairly prolific for someone who has a full time, non writing job, I will generally produce two to three feature scripts a year, and I'm quite disciplined in my writing.

01:11:49.278 --> 01:11:56.858
<v Chas Fisher>And so it's become part of my personality but also part of my enjoyment of life, Right, Like writing,

01:11:57.148 --> 01:12:05.468
<v Chas Fisher>makes me happy, and I always applaud Thie script notes episode where they brought on a psychologist.

01:12:05.468 --> 01:12:12.598
<v Chas Fisher>I think it was Columbo was like psychologists who was talking about like, It's okay to quit.

01:12:12.648 --> 01:12:25.718
<v Chas Fisher>And I do applaud that because there've been times when I'm like the amount of hours that I poured into this over the last number of years. Like surely there'd be something better to pour my time into, but ultimately, because I get pleasure from it.

01:12:25.768 --> 01:12:38.398
<v Chas Fisher>No, it hasn't. I'm still hanging in there, but in the last year of my life, my father in law was diagnosed with early onset Alzheimer's.

01:12:38.574 --> 01:12:41.624
<v Stu Willis>God, you're You're opening up with the whole back. Horrible, Baxter.

01:12:38.988 --> 01:12:47.538
<v Chas Fisher>I mean, well, e want to give a brief summary to give people an idea of the scale of it.

01:12:47.568 --> 01:12:51.298
<v Chas Fisher>My mother in law has been diagnosed with terminal cancer.

01:12:51.688 --> 01:13:01.348
<v Chas Fisher>My wife is there any child, and in amongst that my aunt has died. Who's my only my mother's only sibling on DH?

01:13:01.358 --> 01:13:10.116
<v Chas Fisher>My wife and I have had our own kind of separate problems, and we've got two small *** children which of their own massive time suck. So it just means.

01:13:10.950 --> 01:13:13.140
<v Stu Willis>Who's there's May and who's the?

01:13:15.306 --> 01:13:22.916
<v Chas Fisher>Ah, on DH in Amongst that very little writing got done in the last year of my life.

01:13:23.806 --> 01:13:30.316
<v Chas Fisher>And so part of me despairs because I've lost that therapy. I've lost that part of my life. That brings me joy.

01:13:31.006 --> 01:13:34.546
<v Chas Fisher>But on top of that, it's made me go our ***.

01:13:34.546 --> 01:13:40.376
<v Chas Fisher>I'm not producing new material, which means I'm not, you know, keeping my contacts live with new stuff.

01:13:40.376 --> 01:13:51.516
<v Chas Fisher>And I'm not like pushing my career along, and I'm not writing that next thing that could be the thing that starts it, and and suddenly not only do I have a ll this other ***,

01:13:52.106 --> 01:14:01.056
<v Chas Fisher>but I'm also beating myself up for not writing, and I'm just here, I guess.

01:14:01.066 --> 01:14:10.006
<v Chas Fisher>The wanting to say to all the people out there who, you know, I listen to these podcast like the right along podcast, where is, like, just set a manageable goal every day and hit that.

01:14:10.016 --> 01:14:13.966
<v Chas Fisher>And I'm like, I can't even do that with where I'm at in my life of the moment.

01:14:14.706 --> 01:14:24.416
<v Chas Fisher>From someone who was incredibly disciplined to not even being able to say I'm going to write a page a day or even a paragraph a day like I don't have that space in my life,

01:14:25.006 --> 01:14:32.786
<v Chas Fisher>and I want it Oh, I guess, say to the people who are struggling for whatever reason, with writing that, it doesn't mean you've quit.

01:14:33.026 --> 01:14:37.026
<v Chas Fisher>If you don't want it to mean that you haven't quit and that's where I'm at.

01:14:37.036 --> 01:14:48.966
<v Chas Fisher>I haven't quit, but I'm forgiving myself for not writing as much as I've had, because thank you, because beating myself up about it is helping.

01:14:49.026 --> 01:14:50.966
<v Chas Fisher>No one is not helping me write more.

01:14:51.076 --> 01:14:53.336
<v Chas Fisher>It's not helping my life situation.

01:14:53.812 --> 01:15:06.702
<v Stu Willis>In fact, it can actually kind of produce its own writer's block because you end up spending, you end up spending emotional energy in feeling guilty about not writing when they're maybe that time you can get tiny little bit.

01:15:06.712 --> 01:15:16.592
<v Stu Willis>You can accumulate that kind of little *** Greece that the bottle on the detained can scrape together. And you might find some time to write emotional energy because often I'm not going. I am not going into my ship.

01:15:16.712 --> 01:15:20.492
<v Stu Willis>But I've had a pretty bad, no different way bad to you.

01:15:21.220 --> 01:15:22.230
<v Chas Fisher>You can't compare.

01:15:22.412 --> 01:15:29.592
<v Stu Willis>You can't. I've had my own things to struggle with in two thousand nineteen, and I've just got no gas in the tank, Right?

01:15:29.662 --> 01:15:36.322
<v Stu Willis>I did hand into script and *** January and kind of burnout on top of the personal stuff, right?

01:15:36.712 --> 01:15:48.732
<v Stu Willis>You know, having two scripts. You In January, I cut one hundred *** ads in two months for a huge project, whereas like sleeping in the office and all that *** like I was exhausted and then other *** came on top of it.

01:15:49.002 --> 01:16:00.022
<v Stu Willis>Personal stuff. And I just got no emotional energy to putting running, and I love writing, but running drains me emotionally right, like it should,

01:16:00.512 --> 01:16:06.022
<v Stu Willis>you know, it's uses, you know, when I'm writing well, it uses parts of myself.

01:16:06.412 --> 01:16:14.412
<v Stu Willis>You know, I'm one of those people that cries when they write. I'm going. Come on. Not in like I'm running like not as in writing as therapy.

01:16:14.512 --> 01:16:20.962
<v Stu Willis>But, you know, I get into the emotional experience of writing and, God, we should put it right out front.

01:16:20.972 --> 01:16:23.432
<v Stu Willis>I'm gonna put it right from my one piece of advice.

01:16:23.742 --> 01:16:30.322
<v Stu Willis>I got back in film school and is always and only gets more through every year I write, which is right. The experience.

01:16:31.122 --> 01:16:40.612
<v Stu Willis>That's the fundamental thing of whatever you're doing, whether it's drama, comedy, whatever, like non narrative, blah, blah, blah.

01:16:40.612 --> 01:16:46.272
<v Stu Willis>You're right in terms of a selling document, brightly experience work out.

01:16:46.282 --> 01:16:51.452
<v Stu Willis>Your job as a writer is to work out how to write the experience off whatever it is you're trying to make.

01:16:51.672 --> 01:16:54.422
<v Stu Willis>Put that in the front of the episode, and we don't have to include it here.

01:16:55.282 --> 01:17:08.142
<v Stu Willis>But if you've got just know gas in the tank, that's nothing to draw from everything. I'm going to write his *** so and me feeling guilt about not writing which I do because I've had a friend going.

01:17:01.054 --> 01:17:01.364
<v Chas Fisher>Them.

01:17:08.302 --> 01:17:12.802
<v Stu Willis>You're finding time to right now like I know what's going on because your time find too right. It's not you.

01:17:13.192 --> 01:17:21.352
<v Stu Willis>It's like that just makes me feel worse. And that means you're feeling anxious about it. Just burns whatever. Little *** a little bit of fuel's left, you know?

01:17:21.522 --> 01:17:24.142
<v Stu Willis>But at some point, I know because I'm just I'm different from you.

01:17:24.142 --> 01:17:38.602
<v Stu Willis>You have a lot more disciplined. I'm like I got a project on and then we got folks, we got a deadline of two weeks go crazy, but are, you know, because largely have had a lifestyle where Aiken rejig stuff around to make that work.

01:17:39.192 --> 01:17:41.962
<v Stu Willis>But at this point, I can't even do stuff.

01:17:41.972 --> 01:17:48.302
<v Stu Willis>But, you know, thinking back on it, there's kind of a couple more personal journal Lee stuff that I've written.

01:17:48.372 --> 01:17:58.492
<v Stu Willis>I start writing in my journal, but I really some weird kind of Facebook self reflective Facebook posts which were serving as a former writing, you know, But they're not narrative.

01:17:58.930 --> 01:18:09.110
<v Chas Fisher>But they're feeding that that it's now. I guess I want to couch this in the like. The warning is yes, forgive yourself for not writing right, but so I was.

01:18:09.120 --> 01:18:20.930
<v Chas Fisher>There was a couple of points where in this journey I was feeling that I needed to write, and I actually managed to negotiate with everything that was going on my life and build time to write and found that,

01:18:21.090 --> 01:18:24.620
<v Chas Fisher>hour and a half and I sat down and I just had nothing, right.

01:18:24.620 --> 01:18:33.190
<v Chas Fisher>And I end up playing IOS games for an hour and a half and then felt guilty because I'd wasted this time that I had fought so hard. Tio have.

01:18:33.490 --> 01:18:39.430
<v Chas Fisher>And so it's not about, you know, I don't wantto, I guess, endorse people giving into the,

01:18:40.260 --> 01:18:48.730
<v Chas Fisher>the fallacy of Oh, I I'm struggling and I can't write under these circumstances or what have you like.

01:18:48.740 --> 01:18:59.240
<v Chas Fisher>I don't want to get in the way of people doing what they need to do to get to the point of writing, but I am there again where I can write again on DH.

01:18:59.630 --> 01:19:09.340
<v Chas Fisher>It's just been about making that time available and not putting pressure on myself. to do it or not, but just making the space available in my life.

01:19:09.873 --> 01:19:16.903
<v Stu Willis>Yeah, I guess there's a quote which I'm not going to endorse, but I'm going to say it, which is?

01:19:16.993 --> 01:19:19.183
<v Stu Willis>Writers don't fail. They just go.

01:19:21.073 --> 01:19:31.283
<v Stu Willis>And the problem is, is assumes that it's a binary and unfortunately, the problem so many things in this world is they're not binaries. We just like to put make compile Aries, right.

01:19:30.830 --> 01:19:35.170
<v Chas Fisher>Yeah, like character decisions in an upcoming episode of draft zero.

01:19:35.673 --> 01:19:45.983
<v Stu Willis>Well or everything we like putting into via Larry because it's simple. And the sad truth is, the reason we feel the need to do that with is just because everything is just *** shades of grey.

01:19:46.333 --> 01:19:49.073
<v Stu Willis>And I think then therefore it's easier to go.

01:19:49.073 --> 01:20:02.483
<v Stu Willis>Well, if I'm not writing and I've either quitted or I've failed and because I don't believe in failure, that means I've quitted and it's like, Well, no, you know, maybe a long time.

01:20:02.483 --> 01:20:14.013
<v Stu Willis>And what does it look like? I mean, I'm far less concerned about my screenwriting career than I am about my directing one, but that's a conversation for a podcast called Take Zero where I talk about direct, not this one.

01:20:14.103 --> 01:20:25.313
<v Stu Willis>But I think it's important to say it's okay to take pauses and to replenish the well which we've talked about before. Sometimes you need to go on just what stuff that's creative and find that weighs Teo.

01:20:25.323 --> 01:20:28.173
<v Stu Willis>Self care has become a term that goes around a lot.

01:20:28.463 --> 01:20:37.653
<v Stu Willis>But I think also when you're an emerging creative burnout is a factor, right and that we often think about it, burn out in the context of work.

01:20:37.663 --> 01:20:48.813
<v Stu Willis>And certainly because I'm freelance, my whole life feels like on the teetering on the edge of rejection that there's some point when you know, I Yep, I got no more energy to deal with.

01:20:48.813 --> 01:21:01.743
<v Stu Willis>Rejection in every facet of my life that way actually feed our own burnout with our hobbies as hobby. Quite according hubby of screenwriting.

01:21:01.883 --> 01:21:12.893
<v Stu Willis>Well, if we're not getting a well in my case and yours too, it's semi professional. I make money from riding does not a lot, but you can suffer from burn out.

01:21:13.023 --> 01:21:26.013
<v Stu Willis>You know, I don't think burnout is exclusive as much as those articles to all you work in a creative field or you're a lawyer or you're a ll. This and all that. It's like, Well, you could be burned out from *** life, You know.

01:21:26.775 --> 01:21:34.185
<v Chas Fisher>Well, I guess sorry to end on such a depressing topic, but I hope that it's something that,

01:21:35.975 --> 01:21:41.785
<v Chas Fisher>eyes relatable to our listeners and that people can actually take her heart from.

01:21:42.303 --> 01:21:55.113
<v Stu Willis>I don't think with the thing with writing. To me, it's not depressing, like maybe I will not pick up the keyboard pen for ten years. But I can, because the cost of entry is so low.

01:21:55.503 --> 01:22:05.413
<v Stu Willis>And one of the advantages of screenwriting, unlike dragging, is that it's free and that largely they only give a *** about the reading words on the page.

01:22:05.903 --> 01:22:09.993
<v Stu Willis>You know, like guest meetings were part if you want screenwriting career and all that stuff.

01:22:09.993 --> 01:22:18.793
<v Stu Willis>But if you just weren't right, something that people are potentially going to make and that may be the one thing you ever do on, that's fine because that's what the process of being an artist is.

01:22:18.793 --> 01:22:25.953
<v Stu Willis>Sometime you can do it, and that may sound like me being native, but it's actually like a positive.

01:22:25.953 --> 01:22:34.753
<v Stu Willis>It's always going to be there. It's not goingto run away. And yes, you, you might get creaky and get a bit rusty.

01:22:35.003 --> 01:22:37.513
<v Stu Willis>But it's not going to disappear. I guess it's like riding a bike.

01:22:38.383 --> 01:22:49.013
<v Stu Willis>In that sense, you know, I'm not going to like when I turn up to a meeting training people to finance my feature. When I'm like forty something, I'm washed up. That's different.

01:22:51.203 --> 01:22:52.503
<v Stu Willis>That is a sour note.

01:22:54.291 --> 01:23:00.821
<v Chas Fisher>Well on a positive note, we would love to thank our patrons.

01:23:00.831 --> 01:23:07.011
<v Chas Fisher>I feel us diving into patriot has been riel.

01:23:08.001 --> 01:23:21.461
<v Chas Fisher>Success for us in the we were looking for ways to in amongst full time work, trying to write and to record draft zero plus life ***.

01:23:21.961 --> 01:23:28.231
<v Chas Fisher>Find a way to incentivise us to release Maur draft zero Mohr often.

01:23:28.701 --> 01:23:37.261
<v Chas Fisher>And we could have done that through advertising. We could have done that through pay walls, and I think Patriot has been by far the best way to do it.

01:23:37.431 --> 01:23:46.061
<v Chas Fisher>We still haven't hit the levels we where we could employ someone to do post for us, which would allow us to get you guys mohr draft zero muchmore often.

01:23:46.121 --> 01:24:00.841
<v Chas Fisher>But the money that you guys do contribute has definitely, you know, it may feel to you guys dear listeners, that we don't get episodes to you very often. But trust me, your contributions are making them get to you more often than they otherwise would.

01:24:01.081 --> 01:24:05.241
<v Chas Fisher>So thank you so much to all of you. Our patrons.

01:24:05.251 --> 01:24:13.001
<v Chas Fisher>I Stuart, I've had various conversations where I thought we would get, like one hundred one dollars.

01:24:13.311 --> 01:24:15.511
<v Chas Fisher>Patri ins on DH.

01:24:16.201 --> 01:24:29.081
<v Chas Fisher>What it's turned out to be is we've got very, very few one dollar patrons and a whole lot of top tier patriots who want to engage us with dialogue who seemed to like what we do really want to support us.

01:24:30.501 --> 01:24:35.101
<v Chas Fisher>So very huge, thanks to you guys.

01:24:35.311 --> 01:24:46.711
<v Chas Fisher>Stewart. I think you said that one of the things that that your money is going to is already we're We're trying to do transcripts and trying to get them up on,

01:24:47.401 --> 01:24:50.931
<v Chas Fisher>on the website, and that's already yielding some results.

01:24:52.665 --> 01:25:00.725
<v Stu Willis>Yes, Well, I mean, we're paying. Yes, we're doing computerised transcripts partly because, you know, podcast so great is an audio form.

01:24:53.201 --> 01:24:54.581
<v Chas Fisher>Some humorous.

01:25:00.725 --> 01:25:10.215
<v Stu Willis>But if you're, you know, manoeuvring Khun here and having transcripts available Ideally, he cleaned up by human.

01:25:10.215 --> 01:25:20.775
<v Stu Willis>So it's accessible. Tow a ride variety of people is important, but it's also important for like, searching and cross referencing. And in future, some of the archiving.

01:25:20.785 --> 01:25:33.785
<v Stu Willis>There is tech coming with podcasts like players where you, Khun, search within an episode and jump to specific parts of the episode based on search results that will be tied to the transcripts. So that's awesome.

01:25:33.965 --> 01:25:46.575
<v Chas Fisher>All that said and done particular special, thanks to Cary Harris, Devin Pull Gregory, Chris Walker, Crab Edmonds, Rob Draper, Daniel Bernanke and Sandra,

01:25:47.325 --> 01:25:48.975
<v Chas Fisher>A. Blessing Entra.

01:25:49.475 --> 01:25:52.495
<v Stu Willis>Yeah, and if you want to become a patron, will include links in the show.

01:25:52.495 --> 01:26:01.585
<v Stu Willis>Notes. You'LL also get access to discount emerge. Nice, but if you prefer just to buy a hoodie or shirt or a pillow case or a toe.

01:26:01.585 --> 01:26:09.365
<v Stu Willis>Paige, there's a link in the show notes to our tea Public page Maur designs come soon beaches by the current design.

01:26:09.505 --> 01:26:11.385
<v Stu Willis>I certainly rocket all the time.

01:26:12.455 --> 01:26:15.385
<v Stu Willis>Chazz is not cool enough, so I wouldn't let him have one.

01:26:15.431 --> 01:26:27.941
<v Chas Fisher>The biggest incentive for our Patriots appears to be like voting on our homework. If you want to. John's devote on the films that we consider, yes, that's one way to get involved.

01:26:27.875 --> 01:26:31.095
<v Stu Willis>On DH, I guess.

01:26:31.185 --> 01:26:43.235
<v Stu Willis>I mean, we just you know, we're rambling at this point. Are you speaking about the regularity of the episodes? I think we've reached an interesting point. We had this conversation before we recorded this, but it's worth kind of ending on that.

01:26:43.245 --> 01:26:57.355
<v Stu Willis>Think when we first started out, there was a bunch of really clear or seemingly clear topics. We wanted to cover mid points, point of view status and then we kind of and we had a few examples, like Tarantino TV pilots.

01:26:57.665 --> 01:27:04.265
<v Stu Willis>But as we've developed, we've covered a lot of those simple topics, and now we're getting interested in stuff that's a lack of a better word. Esoteric.

01:27:04.755 --> 01:27:11.185
<v Stu Willis>And it could be realistically that we end up releasing fewer episodes, but each episode being a deeper dive.

01:27:11.255 --> 01:27:19.295
<v Stu Willis>If we can motivate ourselves to do homework, for example, and I'm not, I'm not making no promises because it's taken us over a *** year to do,

01:27:19.775 --> 01:27:27.365
<v Stu Willis>get around to Sofia Coppola, but would be *** amazing to do the three like it, Not it the Shining.

01:27:27.855 --> 01:27:36.035
<v Stu Willis>I think the winnings to do this shining, read the book, look at the Kubrick movie and look at the television Siris.

01:27:37.165 --> 01:27:44.695
<v Stu Willis>Kind of compare the adaptations to me that would be a really fascinating exercise that would probably encompass the whole bunch of other *** that we've learned.

01:27:44.875 --> 01:27:58.265
<v Stu Willis>But that's a serious amount of work. So it's very possible if we decide to go down to, basically will be doing, like, Game of Thrones like Season Seven Night, where it's like we're only gonna do six episodes, but they're going to be like double length episodes and in a way, two years for it. But they'LL be awesome.

01:27:58.855 --> 01:28:07.725
<v Stu Willis>And but that's why we do a per episode model for draft zero rather than a monthly, because it means you only pay for when we release.

01:28:08.566 --> 01:28:23.536
<v Chas Fisher>So thanks, everyone. We will see you soon with the Promise. Game of Thrones episode on DH Upcoming episodes are, as jurors said, the long awaited Sofia Coppola episode as well as Mohr explorations off character journeys.
