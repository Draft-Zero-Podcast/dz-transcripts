# Dz-31: Tools For Better Dialogue

#### How does dialogue serve to reveal character?

2018, Chas Fisher & Stu Willis  
Draft Zero: a screenwriting pocast  

Chas & Stu are joined once again by the renowned script developer and
producer, Stephen Cleary. In the first part of our series on writing
better dialogue (there will be more\!), we take a close look at how
dialogue serves character: individuating characters, revealing
characterisation, shifting status, and much more. Together, they (well,
mostly Stephen) break down scenes from ANALYSE THIS, NOTTING HILL,
REMAINS OF THE DAY and THE AVENGERS. In a first for Draft Zero, we
include audio excerpts to make everything even clearer / stop Chas & Stu
(mostly Stu) from butchering lines. That, and not everything is on
YouTube. And, in back matter, we continue the discussion into more
academic areas of the difference between theatrical, cinematic and
television dialogue.

## Introduction

**Stephen Cleary:**  
\[0:00\] <span title="0:00 - 0:10">You know you get a car when you boil
it and ask you know or half a swimming pool and then at the end when you
pull it all you left it's like a teaspoon full of you.</span>  

**Chas Fisher:**  
\[0:19\] <span title="0:19 - 0:21">Hi I'm Chas Fisher.</span>  

**Stu Willis:**  
\[0:20\] <span title="0:20 - 0:22">And I'm Stu Willis.</span>  

**Chas Fisher:**  
\[0:22\] <span title="0:22 - 0:27">And this is draft 0 a podcast way to
Aussie filmmakers try to work out what makes great screenplays
work.</span>  

**Stu Willis:**  
\[0:27\] <span title="0:27 - 0:34">And today we are joined by the
inestable in it I can say.</span>  

**Chas Fisher:**  
\[0:34\] <span title="0:34 - 0:35">Inestimable.</span>  

**Stu Willis:**  
\[0:35\] <span title="0:35 - 0:39">Stephen Cleary once again on Drive
0.</span>  

**Stephen Cleary:**  
\[0:39\] <span title="0:39 - 0:41">Thank you great to be here.</span>  

**Stu Willis:**  
\[0:40\] <span title="0:40 - 0:48">We are happy we are talking dialogue
and I live in films and this may end up being part 1 of the two part
thing.</span>  
<span title="0:48 - 0:56">Are under eyelid with Stephen are talking
about the role of cinematic Dialogue in films and kind of stuff I guess
we can be starting.</span>  

\[0:56\] <span title="0:56 - 1:07">Anyway the beginning trying to lay
some groundwork for framework think about dialogue and we can be looking
at the films Nottinghill analyse this and The Avengers.</span>  

**Chas Fisher:**  
\[1:07\] <span title="1:07 - 1:14">I'm really excited about this episode
kids Steven you've been running a Super 8 whole dialogue workshop is
that correct.</span>  

**Stephen Cleary:**  
\[1:14\] <span title="1:14 - 1:22">Yeah that's right now been doing it
for a few years now they got me interested in it actually mainly because
I came into the no.</span>  

\[1:23\] <span title="1:23 - 1:31">Thinking about dialogue on wanting to
find stuff out about it so I went and looked at some books about it and
as ever with film a practice.</span>  
<span title="1:31 - 1:36">I was gonna mildly not mildly very
disappointed in Wanaka find it it's the worst.</span>  
<span title="1:36 - 1:50">They were you thinking about it online but
they were online as always it's like you know if I have things to do
this is actually what it was a kind of detailed look at it and there
isn't really anything out there so I can have had to go away
and.</span>  

\[1:50\] <span title="1:50 - 2:03">Stop thinking about him looking at
myself really and this is quite often the truth the case with things
that I do because there is any way I can grab from so I have to go get
able to do the hard yards myself and order try and work out with
work.</span>  

**Chas Fisher:**  
\[2:04\] <span title="2:04 - 2:06">I know what I really like
about.</span>  

\[2:06\] <span title="2:06 - 2:17">What we learnt about today is it
feels like darling is one of those things that from the outside the
perception is all either some writers do great Dialogue in some writers
don't have it something in hand and it's something that you.</span>  

\[2:18\] <span title="2:18 - 2:27">Can't teach tools to improve it and I
think today we're going to work through some stuff where.</span>  
<span title="2:27 - 2:37">It is like anything I'm in a remember you had
a different exercise on characters and we've applied it a lot that you
know of characters is not something that.</span>  
<span title="2:37 - 2:43">Get outside development people should be able
to come in and it's just a pervy of the right it and you.</span>  
<span title="2:43 - 2:57">In a lecture one said if you just write down
the list of decisions that that character makes then that is how the
audience experience of the character and that is something that you can
look at externally and assess externally and as a writer it empowers you
to.</span>  
<span title="2:57 - 3:05">Address issues where your characters is not
coming across the way that you wanted to so I'm excited to do the same
thing with dialogue.</span>  

**Stu Willis:**  
\[3:05\] <span title="3:05 - 3:18">A bully for me I mean I've always
personally felt the tile is one of the week aspects of my writing and
unstructured I med have opinions about the structure of the dialogue but
generally cause I work with her right as I can't leave her the dialogue
to Mum and Matt mate.</span>  

**Chas Fisher:**  
\[3:18\] <span title="3:18 - 3:19">Truth comes out.</span>  

**Stu Willis:**  
\[3:19\] <span title="3:19 - 3:24">The insecurity like this is kind of
what I want it to say but I think.</span>  

\[3:25\] <span title="3:25 - 3:34">I mean there is something but it's a
natural gift for dial and interns of character voice I mean often when I
think we talked about.</span>  
<span title="3:34 - 3:48">Rise of a gift for dialogue they had it baby
forgot their own distinctive voice so in talking everyone sounds like
talking characters and in Tarantino everyone time sounds like a
Tarantino character even writers like Joss Whedon which is why we
did.</span>  
<span title="3:48 - 3:53">Avengers he is very much about every character
sound the same and.</span>  

**Chas Fisher:**  
\[3:53\] <span title="3:53 - 3:54">Tell the same wish I was
dead.</span>  

**Stu Willis:**  
\[3:54\] <span title="3:54 - 3:55">Found sound.</span>  

**Chas Fisher:**  
\[3:55\] <span title="3:55 - 3:56">Ok</span>  

**Stu Willis:**  
\[3:56\] <span title="3:56 - 4:00">And to me about was something I felt
insecure about and.</span>  

\[4:01\] <span title="4:01 - 4:14">Padding now look dumb some of the
dryland workshop with you also got some tools to help me improve my
dialogue it's not probably like all these tools they're not necessarily
generative tools that hopefully will touch on some of that.</span>  
<span title="4:14 - 4:19">They are very analytical tools to help you
rewrite dialogue so.</span>  

**Stephen Cleary:**  
\[4:19\] <span title="4:19 - 4:25">I don't like most parts of writing is
that you know there are some people who ever again is it
naturally.</span>  
<span title="4:25 - 4:36">But there but you can work out what it is
they're very good at it's not like because every good at you know you do
get people who are better at instinctively writing dialogue I'm in a
starting position is better.</span>  
<span title="4:36 - 4:46">Than others but that's not to say that that
then becomes a mystery that you why they have this gift till you don't
you don't you look at some of these really good at all I can work out
what it is that she's a really good at.</span>  
<span title="4:47 - 4:51">Auspost saying all this is a mysterious girl
that I can never master most right side of string.</span>  

\[4:51\] <span title="4:51 - 5:06">And the and weaknesses most like as
if you ask them would say I think I'm better this and that and I was
having trouble with this in whatever interests in my world right as I
quite often find them wrong if that were the right YG identifies as
their weakness.</span>  
<span title="5:06 - 5:15">Is not a study weakness and wanted in find the
strength is not as we have strep quite often when it is printed weakness
what I enjoy writing what I don't enjoy right.</span>  

**Chas Fisher:**  
\[5:15\] <span title="5:15 - 5:16">Were they comfortable with.</span>  

**Stephen Cleary:**  
\[5:15\] <span title="5:15 - 5:23">Yeah what a comfortable with it
actually quite often rights as a good at things they don't think they
good at and not as brilliant as things that they think they are
bigger.</span>  

**Stu Willis:**  
\[5:24\] <span title="5:24 - 5:36">Events that are coming with these
specific term it's one of the cognitive biases dead by being good at
believe in yourself to be good at something you're actually we can your
ability in it because you become a Big W become lazy.</span>  
<span title="5:36 - 5:42">I can come by to you and weaknesses and when
you can't believe your weekend something can you actually try to make up
for a lot of the 4th.</span>  

**Stephen Cleary:**  
\[5:42\] <span title="5:42 - 5:44">I guess that's why most right to sit
there we could everything.</span>  

**Chas Fisher:**  
\[5:45\] <span title="5:45 - 5:50">Subconsciously just ate my
brilliant.</span>  

**Stu Willis:**  
\[5:49\] <span title="5:49 - 5:53">So I guess where do we
start.</span>  

**Chas Fisher:**  
\[5:52\] <span title="5:52 - 6:03">Where do we start if Cinema dialogue
is a kind of distinct Beast from theatrical dialogue what whatever it's
hallmarks what did you find that.</span>  

**Stephen Cleary:**  
\[6:03\] <span title="6:03 - 6:15">Broadleaf broadly speaking um I'm
going to be making huge analysation cross but I never stop it stop
before broadly speaking as soon as I like a shorter.</span>  

\[6:16\] <span title="6:16 - 6:25">You know much shorter it's not just
short on the sides to speech is done to get shorter so that a long
speech you know more than 10 lines on a screenplay.</span>  
<span title="6:25 - 6:34">Which is your name I suppose not knoq speed is
either is a huge lump of Dialogue in in cinema times but also when you
look at the number syllable.</span>  
<span title="6:35 - 6:45">That you will find an average Cinema dialogue
speech it's unusual to get words of more than 3 syllables very unusual 4
syllable words words are quiet and starkly.</span>  
<span title="6:45 - 6:48">In many in a password or a producer in
place.</span>  
<span title="6:48 - 7:01">It's a good indication of a difference between
unproduced Cinema writer and producer Cinema writer is the temperature
screenplays that you read by people wanting to be screenwriters will
tend to have more 457 words in a screenplay.</span>  

\[7:02\] <span title="7:02 - 7:10">Take it everything is compressed this
is Ikon the point of it is compressed and it's highly stylised.</span>  
<span title="7:10 - 7:22">Even what looks like naturalistic dialogue
when you look at it a comparison to where the people speak in the kinds
of words they use it's very compressed it is very stylizen and the point
is you always driving towards simplicity.</span>  

\[7:23\] <span title="7:23 - 7:29">And that creates an effect and all of
that I think is much more poetic.</span>  
<span title="7:29 - 7:39">Done anything else it's it kind of what the
object of Cinema dialogue is to do is what poetry does which is just
suggest as much as to stay.</span>  

\[7:40\] <span title="7:40 - 7:53">This much more artificer dialogue
than people think that's annoying people think that if for example they
understand how people really talk in real life and they want to write
that receipt dialogue they kind of do that then what you'll have as
natural of anyone.</span>  
<span title="7:53 - 7:55">That's not the dialogue.</span>  

**Chas Fisher:**  
\[7:54\] <span title="7:54 - 7:56">I'm the nurse n.</span>  

**Stephen Cleary:**  
\[7:56\] <span title="7:56 - 7:59">Dialogue it is a constructed
thing.</span>  
<span title="7:59 - 8:11">It's not about it's not an apology you don't
go and record people on this on the bus and then we produce what they
say you are creating an illusion of reality and that's what I like is it
some sense is the Illusion Of Speech.</span>  
<span title="8:11 - 8:17">It's not the best not a creation an accurate
depiction of how people speak it's you it's an illusion of speech that
you.</span>  

\[8:18\] <span title="8:18 - 8:27">Persuade the audience is real but in
fact is absolutely artificial and that's why do you know so much
crafting a Polish in the process.</span>  

**Chas Fisher:**  
\[8:27\] <span title="8:27 - 8:40">And I remember that when we were we
were Film School in you came in late kidding you gave us example I'm
gonna be completely murder it but you were basically talking about
husband and wife driving home and.</span>  

\[8:40\] <span title="8:40 - 8:53">It was about dialogue beat you then
just started layering contacts onto the story am and back story and he
got to the point where because of all the different facts of the
audience knew about this couple in this car.</span>  

\[8:53\] <span title="8:53 - 8:55">Didn't matter what they were talking
about.</span>  

**Stu Willis:**  
\[8:55\] <span title="8:55 - 9:03">She was cheating on Spaceland she was
cheating on husband she didn't know that the husband knew that she was
cheating on husband and so.</span>  

\[9:04\] <span title="9:04 - 9:15">Will basley paceman position is
superior to the Tarantino example I mean it's all that kind of dramatic
irony and then you basin set it up matter what they're saying because it
could be meaning.</span>  

**Chas Fisher:**  
\[9:15\] <span title="9:15 - 9:30">That Tarantino example if we talked
about it what were actually back in so we would we were talking about
before we start recording inglorious bastards and that scene in the
prison cafe where the to kill a Jew Hunter do Hunter and.</span>  
<span title="9:30 - 9:32">The girl can't remember her name.</span>  
<span title="9:32 - 9:40">So they're that and that he's talking about
the arrangements for the cinema screening and strudel and.</span>  

\[9:41\] <span title="9:41 - 9:46">The audience knows that she's talking
to the killer of her family and he's terrified for her life.</span>  

\[9:47\] <span title="9:47 - 9:54">What up to the audience and is kind
of suggested but not stated is he might know and he might suspect or he
might not.</span>  
<span title="9:55 - 10:04">But regardless it doesn't matter what they're
talking about at all even the slightest we did not say darling is
completely irrelevant but that there is.</span>  

**Stephen Cleary:**  
\[10:04\] <span title="10:04 - 10:10">30 size dialogue is the underlying
a movement to mechanics of a story.</span>  
<span title="10:10 - 10:14">That if you don't get this right if you
don't for example create.</span>  
<span title="10:14 - 10:26">Seems a dramatic irony if you don't
understand the move interstate it's in the scene and hug characters are
constantly playing status if you don't create sub text in the way the
scene at organise we'll talk about all of those things.</span>  
<span title="10:26 - 10:41">Maybe a little more detail then you don't
have anything to build on but on top of that you then have ok with
Donald at work with creative subjects with got seems really important
structure to see his work now we know where the action of the scene is
going we've done all that work.</span>  
<span title="10:41 - 10:44">Now how do these people actually
talk.</span>  
<span title="10:45 - 11:00">Know if you haven't done done and alone work
you'll see your dollar will b flat no matter how good you are it you
know creating notice of character I can a poetic residents in the way
that is because the scene isn't resting on anything else other Dalek has
no really because one of your done underlying work and then,</span>  
<span title="11:00 - 11:08">the dollar can dig down into the area then
on top of that you don't have said ok what how does this person speak
and how do I un how do I design.</span>  
<span title="11:08 - 11:16">Organise the way they talk to reflect the
character so that and how do I individuate this character in the scene
vs another car.</span>  

\[11:16\] <span title="11:16 - 11:25">And that requires an understanding
of the first of all the character that you have so what is the social
context that this scene is taking place in what is the education of
this.</span>  

\[11:26\] <span title="11:26 - 11:35">So what kinds of words would they
use in a what class are they from what's the relationship to go to
person this in so this is an older man talking to a younger
woman.</span>  
<span title="11:35 - 11:39">How does man Jenna regard younger women in
relation to himself and society.</span>  
<span title="11:39 - 11:52">Does he regard them is something to be
pushed around as you're going to sell this and that you superior how is
that Express not in in Bull terms like condescending sentences but how
is that Express in terms of specific words they would hear.</span>  

**Chas Fisher:**  
\[11:52\] <span title="11:52 - 11:54">Sweetheart.</span>  

**Stephen Cleary:**  
\[11:54\] <span title="11:54 - 12:00">Exactly that kind of thing where
you usually do you put them does this man unconsciously.</span>  

\[12:01\] <span title="12:01 - 12:11">Press his high level of Education
when he's talking to people he thinks so not as important as he is so
what are you slightly more important words that he would not use if you
were talking to a general.</span>  
<span title="12:11 - 12:25">You know where he would tend to simplify his
language because he's at he's talking to it at least on his own level
possibly higher so he would he would not want to be picked up cuz that
person may turn around him so why don't you use simpler word in this
country.</span>  
<span title="12:26 - 12:37">You know because the dude there is that
possibility that he's on at a different kind of social level to the
social context the character education they have their classes you did
gender attitude order these things in form,</span>  
<span title="12:37 - 12:43">the choices of the words the characters
would use and it's not just because you say what what would would they
use,</span>  
<span title="12:43 - 12:52">at the dollar great you're saying all the
time I might and I like I'm reinforcing for the audience who my
character is so I'm going to use these words to illustrate the
fact.</span>  
<span title="12:52 - 13:00">But he is of this social class but he is of
this generation does he does feel this way about younger people
particularly women he does feel this way about himself at set.</span>  
<span title="13:00 - 13:09">So every line of dollar the current user's
amplifying and informing the orders again and again this is the
character and of course for the actor.</span>  

\[13:10\] <span title="13:10 - 13:19">To him scrutinizes every word
every word is a clue to the character so if you don't do that writing
with the kind of concern necessary that are good at.</span>  

\[13:20\] <span title="13:20 - 13:29">I want to change the line because
it is not doing enough it doesn't inform enough doesn't allow me to
understand the character and if you mention as a writer.</span>  

\[13:29\] <span title="13:29 - 13:39">Imagine if you can set your
screenplay to an actor and there was no descriptive Frozen it was like a
fish literally so all the actor has to understand the character of the
things they say.</span>  
<span title="13:40 - 13:45">It's ok if the character if the actor read
that script would they understand who they were.</span>  
<span title="13:45 - 13:59">Without having any introduction contacts
would they be able to work out having read the entire script in their
character what social classes person was what background they had what
kind of age level of Education they have what they thought about things
if your dollar doesn't do that.</span>  
<span title="13:59 - 14:02">Tell us your not giving the actor enough to
work with.</span>  

**Chas Fisher:**  
\[14:02\] <span title="14:02 - 14:12">I think that's a good challenges I
don't know final draught or some of the soft screenwriting Subway can do
this but just like taking the lines and the scene take all the the big
print all the action.</span>  

\[14:13\] <span title="14:13 - 14:19">Out of a screenplay and just look
at the dialogue and see the characters constructed.</span>  

**Stu Willis:**  
\[14:18\] <span title="14:18 - 14:29">I'm coming Judith Western who's
there a teacher but also directing actors teacher that mention her
before she actually says when you get a screenplay is a director is an
actor does cross out all the big print.</span>  

\[14:30\] <span title="14:30 - 14:38">Just look at the dialogue to
inform your character and all the prep and all the power of tentacles
and all that stuff make specifically ignore everything.</span>  
<span title="14:38 - 14:47">Button dialogue when I get to the root the
characters so it's certainly think that people are taught to do as a way
of engaging with character so here.</span>  

\[14:48\] <span title="14:48 - 14:49">Flight flight 50.</span>  
<span title="14:49 - 15:03">Well it's now talking about characterisation
but there's other functions of dialogue I mean giving maybe my interest
in science fiction and Thrillers univ expositions a big thing and that's
something we get us all about a lot like how do you handle exposition
how do you make exposition.</span>  
<span title="15:04 - 15:12">Good and often dialogues criticized as being
too expository you know what are they kinda I guess.</span>  

\[15:12\] <span title="15:12 - 15:24">Maybe trying to find out what good
dialogue is in a what are hallmarks of bag dialogue or is it one of
those things are bad dialogue is not good. Which comes first if that
makes sense.</span>  

**Stephen Cleary:**  
\[15:23\] <span title="15:23 - 15:29">The trick to make dialogue always
good I would say if you can eat a place to have some tea.</span>  
<span title="15:29 - 15:36">You know it is to have a line where there
are two things going on at any given moment is the meaning of what is
being spoken.</span>  
<span title="15:36 - 15:44">And there is the unspoken meaning of what is
going on at that moment so if you're trying to do exposition if he wants
to have a character say um I don't know the cheese is in the
fridge.</span>  
<span title="15:45 - 15:52">Because we have to let you on his know the
cheese in the fridge have to create a contact whereby when the character
says the cheese in the fridge them in something else.</span>  

\[15:52\] <span title="15:52 - 16:00">So for example yeah I don't know
the it's it's a way of using anything like that when it's a Weber
character.</span>  
<span title="16:00 - 16:05">Canada meeting another character in the C\&C
3 people to see in one guys financing clever.</span>  
<span title="16:05 - 16:20">Different the girl on cedilla guy uses the
fact that he knows the cheese in the fridge to cut the other guy from
under the cut his knees from Monday then so when it says the cheese in
the fridge two things happen thirsty when it's go overseas in the fridge
exactly what is go he doesn't like that guy.</span>  

\[16:21\] <span title="16:21 - 16:29">And as long as there's another
thing under the surface is it doesn't as a Whatsapp text Will meaning
that you want to understand then that the line have dimension.</span>  
<span title="16:29 - 16:37">And I think the trouble exposition is not
that is exposition but the trouble that position normally hasn't
dialogue is it there's nothing else in going on in the line.</span>  
<span title="16:37 - 16:47">So they won't when it's delivered it's just
simply bold exposition that's the problem there's nothing wrong
exposition in dialogue I mean if you use it to excessive
obviously.</span>  
<span title="16:47 - 16:57">The writing is weird but nothing inherently
wrong in it as long as you find a way of giving the line Dimension in
complexity so that you would you give you one is something else did to
think about.</span>  

**Stu Willis:**  
\[16:57\] <span title="16:57 - 17:06">So maybe now is a good point for
us to Segway into analyse the 1st about scripts because this because I
think what you kind of driving at there's plot exposition.</span>  
<span title="17:06 - 17:14">Right which is a stop ringing to know to
keep the plumbing for but there's also kind of courage exposition
Matraville and character actually giving.</span>  
<span title="17:14 - 17:23">Xmas break away when reviewing exposition
another word for reveal input information and characterizations another
word for reviewing character information.</span>  

\[17:23\] <span title="17:23 - 17:30">So maybe we should look at cos I
think it's it's an early scene and it's clearly setting up a both
aspects.</span>

**Stephen Cleary:**  
\[23:12\] <span title="23:12 - 23:14">This is what in.</span>  
<span title="23:14 - 23:29">Are you known Room in Rome common cause of
acute me to see if it's a busy meeting to the right of job here is to
throw the Jew character together an interesting way that's exciting I'm
an intriguing for the audience and makes them by the end of the same
thinking crikey when's this going to go now.</span>  
<span title="23:29 - 23:36">So that's what they did the general function
of the scene but it's a very interesting because it first of all it
plays beautifully on stage at switches.</span>  
<span title="23:36 - 23:43">Something we win it will be talking about NZ
the choice is to have John Betty who is an extremely powerful
mobster.</span>  

**Stu Willis:**  
\[23:43\] <span title="23:43 - 23:45">Robert De Niro for those are only
hearing.</span>  

**Stephen Cleary:**  
\[23:45\] <span title="23:45 - 23:57">Walking into the office of a bent
over so it's it's Sobels office until it says with his territory and
it's his the place where he should be most comfortable and most relax
and have the most power.</span>  
<span title="23:57 - 24:03">And what happens if this other person walks
into his room is a enormous huge reversal.</span>  
<span title="24:03 - 24:07">It does initially I think it has a little
Prelude why you have this guy jelly,</span>  
<span title="24:07 - 24:13">walk and that he throws out the first the
patients in the room and then John Vicky Robert area walks in,</span>  
<span title="24:13 - 24:26">I needed the decision the scene again to to
have a sleep early it is a kind of play on what's going to happen in a
minute so ball is in his room in an intruder comes out and he deals with
him or tries to deal with them and then I even bigger Intruder comes
in.</span>  
<span title="24:27 - 24:31">So rather than it's a kind of little Prelude
and it's quite funny because it's been is very active.</span>  
<span title="24:32 - 24:44">So what is reacted when the first into the
companies like get out of here you can't come in here this is a bit late
this is an office everything's happening here and he's very very active
and he is talking a lot,</span>  
<span title="24:44 - 24:53">I've been very assertive and then as soon as
he comes in this is again what type of dollars what people don't say as
soon as he comes then he stops talking.</span>  
<span title="24:53 - 24:55">He goes from long sentences to short
set.</span>  

\[24:56\] <span title="24:56 - 25:09">Looking at it after I did it was
really obvious but actually it's not letting you know you could write
the sea in a number of different ways you could have so we'll come over
jabbering when the man comes in and you know over talking right under
talking but it's.</span>  
<span title="25:09 - 25:15">To set up with long sentences with mango two
short sentences which one is this into it so bored this is in the sea
now.</span>  
<span title="25:15 - 25:21">The long sentences which goes absolutely
minimal sent yes no it hehe she said.</span>  

**Chas Fisher:**  
\[25:21\] <span title="25:21 - 25:29">Minutes is interesting we talked
about I'm looking at the crossover from page 25 26 and it goes from
Ben.</span>  
<span title="25:29 - 25:42">They're saying it's got a three line
sentence to Jelly listen if you're upset about your car I can understand
that beat you don't just barge in here and then it dash dash gets
interrupted Paul Beattie steps into the office then freezes
videos.</span>  
<span title="25:42 - 25:46">You know who I am then says yes so like the
transition is instant.</span>  

**Stu Willis:**  
\[25:46\] <span title="25:46 - 26:00">And what's interesting is it set
up Ben when he's talking to Carl his first patient Ben is giving a long
flying almost flying centres in essays you a lot of comments you
speaking and call it's like you're right I do you're right I
did.</span>  

\[26:01\] <span title="26:01 - 26:09">I don't know we just seeing what a
low status character that plays in the same that they don't talk very
much.</span>  

\[26:09\] <span title="26:09 - 26:18">And been doing all the talking and
then Ben is basically put in the position of Carl and we know that
subconsciously because we've seen car Tweed.</span>  

**Chas Fisher:**  
\[26:17\] <span title="26:17 - 26:18">We just seen it.</span>  

**Stu Willis:**  
\[26:18\] <span title="26:18 - 26:23">We just seen in this situation
that's done a shift so we have a high tennis coach of the Kama
logo.</span>  

**Stephen Cleary:**  
\[26:23\] <span title="26:23 - 26:31">If you if you take this soon and
you to call the dollar blinds out and you said I said of a server saying
whatever the words are written on the page just say mumble.</span>  
<span title="26:31 - 26:45">7 weeks and Mum both as mumble mumble mumble
mumble mumble mumble and you played the seeing you could you listen to
it you would hear the movement of status and power in the Seas simply by
the sounds they make.</span>  
<span title="26:45 - 26:50">I'm just listening for anything at to think
about when you're writing or dialogue scenes is a rhythm here.</span>  
<span title="26:50 - 27:03">In a desert desert there's an underlying to
the structural rhythm to the scene which is that it's. He starts as long
as mumble mumble mumble mumble then it goes mumble mumble mumble mumble
mumble mumble and then has the thing starts to develop and their
relation to Unity character.</span>  
<span title="27:04 - 27:05">Gets more complex.</span>  
<span title="27:05 - 27:19">And so will start to come more into the sea
he starts to speak longer sentences again and see where it goes from
mumble mumble mumble mumble to Mumble to mumble mumble and then mumble
mumble mumble at the end is mumble mumble and so the Eggheads a
rhythm.</span>  
<span title="27:19 - 27:24">And what's the pleasure of the scene for the
audience is not just what they're saying but it's just appreciation of
the Rhythm.</span>  
<span title="27:25 - 27:39">If you look at the scene in a different ways
it's actually built around a pack of 3 years rep repeated 3 years or all
the way through this say it and it's rather like a song wouldn't have
particular time with you it's if you look if you go to the very
beginning of the.</span>  
<span title="27:39 - 27:47">Odyssey maze talking to her soul Blues
talking to his patient and he says Kyle undertake impact of her you seem
to settle to his me for things you're right I do.</span>  

\[27:48\] <span title="27:48 - 27:58">See you did it again I suggest or
something immediately agree you're right I did too why do you think you
do this I don't know 3 so as long centre short reply long sounds
awesome.</span>  
<span title="27:58 - 27:59">Long centre shortly.</span>  
<span title="28:00 - 28:08">Does a person Reserve I think it's your Dad
and we have a sentence after that but she's ready three witches long
sentence short reply long so the short reply long son it's
shorter.</span>  
<span title="28:09 - 28:18">And then we have this sentence I think it's
called it's your fear of rejection or feel disapproval but you don't
have to worry about that be romanced and around hey don't let people
roll over you.</span>  
<span title="28:18 - 28:25">I guess you have a long so it's it's it's
long short long short long short long long long and then at that
point.</span>  
<span title="28:26 - 28:34">Bang incomes Intruder to the point with the
longest sentence in the sea up to this point it is delivered the
Intruder walks and suddenly Everything takes off again.</span>  
<span title="28:34 - 28:45">How do you say what are you doing here I'm
go back into some short as soon as hey, soul excuse me yeah I know I'm
sorry I know you bingo says jelly I just like it's back to percussive
short words again.</span>  
<span title="28:45 - 28:55">So it is kind of me later think of it like
her a piece of jazz music with something at the rhythm and the movement
of the language and and vitality the scene comes from that.</span>  
<span title="28:55 - 29:06">How often do right to say ok how many words
do I have any sweet as what it would have a very the number of words how
many one word sentences do I have in this in this is full of one word
sentence.</span>  
<span title="29:06 - 29:16">2 word sentences in that gives if I can a
dynamic movement because then you shift at the longer sentences so
there's a kind of rhythmic movement under the sea the gym music in the
scene.</span>  
<span title="29:16 - 29:19">It doesn't matter who the characters
are.</span>  

\[29:19\] <span title="29:19 - 29:26">I mean you're creating this music
in the way you're bringing the characters together but the characters
don't change because of the length of the sentence.</span>  
<span title="29:26 - 29:36">For the writer is giving a cat a resume
beating can a patterns the underlying movement of the language that
gives it about to the vitality this is what I mean about
poetry.</span>  
<span title="29:36 - 29:50">This is what post they understand because of
stress as the number of syllables in a line the variation of Settlers
the move between the weather language has an innate rhythm under certain
the words you choose this sound of those were not the meaning the sound
of the word.</span>  
<span title="29:50 - 29:57">Affects the way the rhythm plays and that's
how a poet writes and has a dial a writer as well as all the stuff we
have to do,</span>  
<span title="29:57 - 30:11">there is also this underlying sense of the
music of this of the scene would you landed in Incheon is modulated it
or affected by the music of the characters the actual distinctive Potter
this weekend at the characters and all of that is going on in the
sea.</span>  

**Stu Willis:**  
\[30:12\] <span title="30:12 - 30:23">So how to what if this you know
how the distinctive voices of Ben and vid and Cole kind of credit cause
we've got the repetition of that same kind of three stretch with me you
know me then yes.</span>  
<span title="30:23 - 30:29">Didn't know you don't ok you see my picture
in the papers yes no you didn't you've got that rhythm and you know
that.</span>  

\[30:29\] <span title="30:29 - 30:36">You know the Jas kind of thing but
then how do we also build our understanding of character.</span>  

**Chas Fisher:**  
\[30:36\] <span title="30:36 - 30:48">Well I mean that's exactly I was
going to say is going back to your other example about not just looking
at what characters would say and how they talk it's how they talk in
relation to who they're talking to that I think.</span>  
<span title="30:48 - 30:55">Create lot of characterisation and jelly and
Betty from a class point of view.</span>  
<span title="30:55 - 31:10">Are similar background and usually band
would consider himself above both those backgrounds I'm educated I'm not
violent I'm civilized I'm in a profession duh duh duh duh duh and he
plays that way to jelly.</span>  
<span title="31:10 - 31:19">He thinks it's just a guy bumped with his
car and is going to resolve the hat like how do I talk to an essentially
I know Alesso being and then.</span>  

\[31:20\] <span title="31:20 - 31:27">Another version jelly comes in
better version that is clearly higher power and then Ben and so the way
that he change it.</span>  

**Stephen Cleary:**  
\[31:27\] <span title="31:27 - 31:40">I'm in a sentence a great deal
going on in his his his what a sober does is characterisation and in
dollar what's Abel Tasman jelly walks in is he seems jelly as lower
class today what happened with a man into each other car the night
before.</span>  

\[31:40\] <span title="31:40 - 31:46">Eating said jelly is just some fat
Italian American who drives a rather cheap car,</span>  
<span title="31:46 - 31:55">and what he thinks is because he's at a
higher social class and because he's in his own office and feel
comfortable what you think so Jenny just doesn't understand so when
getting worse and he goes,</span>  
<span title="31:55 - 32:06">what you don't understand is as an officer
and I'm doing things and he's talking to jelly and it's like it's it's
slightly condescending you know you you being lower-class and uneducated
don't understand what a psychiatrist might be done.</span>  
<span title="32:07 - 32:10">Do I have to let you know that you can't
simply walk in here and do this.</span>  

\[32:11\] <span title="32:11 - 32:20">I know I'm using the get up the
money and says houses to buy how much money you need to leave I need
Sophie razerzone status of changes of the power dynamic around.</span>  

\[32:20\] <span title="32:20 - 32:29">What what the soul is doing is it
he's trying to explain he's explaining an agitated way but he's trying
to explain because he believes the guy doesn't understand soon as Vicki
Ward.</span>  

\[32:30\] <span title="32:30 - 32:34">Sebel realises mistake
everything's about the Weasley.</span>  
<span title="32:34 - 32:48">Changes but that's what happens when is it
how do we change that had to be able to inform the characters as a
begins to approach the area that he is there to talk about which is his
invulnerability.</span>  
<span title="32:48 - 32:53">This is what's lovely round the weather
dialogue works is that you know he sent to start to get longer.</span>  
<span title="32:53 - 32:59">And he he he walks around and list again
this is a beautiful thing about the right thing who's is the right to
working out.</span>  
<span title="32:59 - 33:09">How do you move from a man who has an
enormous amount of power a little a man walks in the room and almost
think the 4th centre that makes solar system event services please don't
kill me.</span>  

\[33:09\] <span title="33:09 - 33:16">Ok so if you have a man when he
walks into a people so please don't kill me how does that man relax a
person enough.</span>  
<span title="33:16 - 33:24">In order to get them to be competetive a job
in order to get it problems so what are you doing in the next few lines
he's trying to relax.</span>  

\[33:25\] <span title="33:25 - 33:30">So then what's happening is that
sober Liz is taking a long time to write so when he says you
don't.</span>  

\[33:31\] <span title="33:31 - 33:37">Great lines and you have this
report repeating of trees as a sudden just like you ain't got no bugs in
here.</span>  
<span title="33:38 - 33:43">And it goes bugs and then vs bugs bugs
recording equipment three letter.</span>  
<span title="33:43 - 33:51">This is a rhythm to the way you speaking up
that free Rhythm is a bit within the lines and cells and then Ben
Sanders is in reply to that,</span>  
<span title="33:51 - 34:05">is is a longer senses because suddenly were
beginning to get into comfortable ground so there's no no I don't record
I take notes mustard and then if I take notice meant Mr T I tried to
give the guy the insurance information several times as I time he
wouldn't take it.</span>  
<span title="34:06 - 34:15">Please don't kill me OK so see you have this
is beginning to try and expand because he's trying to re-establish in
his power and if I restart a Samsung relationship,</span>  
<span title="34:15 - 34:28">again it's still got this notion they don't
understand these Italian Americans is lower class people they don't get
it you know so he's now he's talking about the car accident you don't
understand it's not important let me explain to you.</span>  

**Chas Fisher:**  
\[34:28\] <span title="34:28 - 34:41">But do you think the vet DeLong
the longer sentences it's not because Ben's feeling more comfortable or
more powerful or even trying to say is power it's almost like it's
almost a show weakness that he starts babbling.</span>  

**Stephen Cleary:**  
\[34:41\] <span title="34:41 - 34:50">He's trying to use trying to Fuse
you a he don't you just got a bubble butt again which underlies this
still is is the essential nature is character which is he believes he
knows more than other peeps.</span>  

\[34:51\] <span title="34:51 - 34:59">And that's this whole film is
about a guy who puts too much trust and intellect in education and it's
lost touch with his.</span>  
<span title="34:59 - 35:08">Basic emotional side it'll be forced to
leave behind an education and it's trust and everything out and he's
going to be forced to speak their language.</span>  
<span title="35:08 - 35:16">That's you know he's literally speak the way
that you want this week to get a talk like a Matthews and so did this
style of these being a producer that is way of speaking.</span>  
<span title="35:16 - 35:18">Connotes a way of thinking.</span>  
<span title="35:18 - 35:28">Which is that a small group with a simpler
the world of the mafia in this film is Brooklyn a simple compared to the
world oh so I can't get time to work out near the complex is Aveeno the
human condition.</span>  

\[35:29\] <span title="35:29 - 35:38">He's going to be he's gonna be
forced into that world and is language is going to be forced into that
will do and this is really important in the evolution of movement of
characters through stories we might look,</span>  
<span title="35:38 - 35:46">blue blazer Richard Curtis again who plays
in completely different contacts with the contact two people falling for
each other romantic.</span>  
<span title="35:46 - 35:54">Then what happens is an x in a romance is an
exchange I know you who you are reveal yourself to someone else you give
you a self.</span>  
<span title="35:54 - 36:02">You give of yourself to someone else and if
you look at the way the dialogue works and this story is the dialogue is
given to each other they start using each other's words and
phrases.</span>  
<span title="36:02 - 36:15">And again in the story with people are
giving all themselves John vichie whether he likes it or not he's going
to have to get close to a sauna Berlin and man and Ben's going to have
to get close to this young back and balls an exchange of
language.</span>  
<span title="36:16 - 36:21">And the dollar will express their the
movement towards each other is a bit specially weather use each other's
language.</span>  
<span title="36:21 - 36:30">Oh and you will have better using
psychiatric expressions in any way that same using it as soon Lee Mack
so John sorry man will do the same the other way.</span>  

**Chas Fisher:**  
\[36:30\] <span title="36:30 - 36:31">So</span>  
<span title="36:32 - 36:46">How does ban in dialogue sorry not been busy
I put down at his keys I mean like we've had the scene and we can hear
it but is there anything we can take from it but the one thing I'm
noticing is for the first part of the session.</span>  
<span title="36:47 - 36:48">It is 1 asking a lot of questions.</span>  
<span title="36:49 - 36:58">And then when they actually start the
session is at work then Ben starts asking questions and it's almost like
you can save whoever's got the status is.</span>  
<span title="36:59 - 37:08">It's not a general rule people who have no
power can be the ones asking all the questions and it could be that the
other persons exendin The Power by refusing to answer but.</span>  
<span title="37:08 - 37:14">It's almost like it's giving Power by
letting him speak by giving him voice.</span>  

**Stephen Cleary:**  
\[37:14\] <span title="37:14 - 37:23">There's a visit this is a few
things around that talk about one of which is generally how useful and
common it is in screenwriting that seem to question.</span>  
<span title="37:23 - 37:31">It's really unusual to find a powerful seen
that doesn't have a lot of questions in it and there's a reason for that
which is that a question demands an answer.</span>  
<span title="37:32 - 37:37">So does would propose the story fallen as
soon as you ask a question I got your if the question is
answered.</span>  
<span title="37:37 - 37:51">Then you move into another hour of the sea
so you've you're pulling the scene for whatever is not answered that it
itself is an incident why is it not being answered the fat is not being
answered if server character refuses to answer a question or Avoid those
who create two subjects you a question.</span>  
<span title="37:51 - 37:56">Why is that character not answering that
question so question is incredibly dynamic.</span>  
<span title="37:56 - 38:05">Kind of sentence to put into the entrance
crap and so it must scream players and most things real power will get a
lot of quest.</span>  
<span title="38:05 - 38:14">It also connect the characters together kind
of in a one person as a question the other than has to reply and there's
an obligation to reply which means a scene has a momentum and a power
with it.</span>  
<span title="38:14 - 38:17">So so in this see what happens is.</span>  

\[38:18\] <span title="38:18 - 38:32">As soon as I sit down and they
start talking with you finally says I mister did the line he he says
were again it's a Long Line so we stop being it is short sentence has a
bin all about you know I'm in control and what is a Starburst control he
done relax.</span>  
<span title="38:32 - 38:39">How many prob me has have to give up control
because you have to give this guy the official needs to be good at what
he does.</span>  
<span title="38:39 - 38:47">Unsettled he says rain about that I don't
care about the car I got a friend it's too short sentences but it's a
long speech a lot of sentences in this in this page.</span>  
<span title="38:47 - 38:55">About that I don't care about the car I got
a friend this friend of mine he's got problems and he's like probably
going to see a shrink so I'm going to have to ask you a couple of
quest.</span>  

\[38:56\] <span title="38:56 - 39:06">Ok so so suddenly we move this
along speak only getting that in itself is it question is it ok if I ask
you questions and so was ok go ahead and then did he get more questions
what do we do now do we say.</span>  
<span title="39:06 - 39:14">Whatever makes you comfortable if he's
giving them is giving the power of the Ban Ban is like what you do what
you like in and he's asking then what do I do.</span>  
<span title="39:15 - 39:26">Navigate to question I'll send over here
make it, fine and then the next section with lids is it to the middle
the story isn't interesting one because Ben is trying to be expensive an
unused long sentences and find out what he's doing.</span>  
<span title="39:26 - 39:37">Which is not you're entirely relax and he
doesn't understand the world and the things that Ben sorry I keep
calling a max with anything and is always trying to do this is under
underneath everything he thinks he's Club.</span>  

\[39:38\] <span title="39:38 - 39:52">And this is true he isn't it
intellectual so it's clever is better educated and I certainly not
street smart like that but he does have a better sense of what the
problem that that he has is and the whole sentence of the
inability.</span>  
<span title="39:52 - 39:57">Of Ben to realise that being cleverer than
someone else is not necessarily an advantage.</span>  
<span title="39:58 - 40:10">This in this scene Beverly wants is actually
going to be the reason he loses it were the same as another question why
don't you tell me why I need therapy and it comes back again and that
because.</span>  
<span title="40:11 - 40:25">The ocean ocean therapy makes me feel
insecure I don't need therapy I just told you that it's my friend again
three sentences duh duh duh duh duh duh duh duh duh duh. This is the
rhythm of this singing every level on the across like three sentences in
a speech will say within a speech,</span>  
<span title="40:25 - 40:29">itself the rely one side only therapy one I
just told you that too it's my friend.</span>  
<span title="40:30 - 40:40">It's always in packets of 3 in the CNS just
the rhythm of this particular scene there's no reason for it there's no
rule what the writer is going to understood but I'm going to drive this
scene and rhythm and patterns of 3.</span>  
<span title="40:40 - 40:43">And that's going to give it it's underlying
cause of a unity.</span>  
<span title="40:43 - 40:52">I'm sorry you didn't hear me say that yeah
I'm sorry you know you guys must be so good if you can't even what I
said two seconds ago again he's be writing and for not listening
probably 3 times.</span>  
<span title="40:53 - 40:58">Ok and then he goes I'm sorry I got to tell
you that I can only change someday I'm not thrilled lover service of
this.</span>  
<span title="40:58 - 41:08">This is where starving yourself then vs is
my for apologizes why do we start over tell me about your friend again
then again and in and then don't even have to alone.</span>  

\[41:09\] <span title="41:09 - 41:13">Elicos the longer the speeches the
longer I tried to talk the more they must reveal.</span>  
<span title="41:13 - 41:23">So as we want I won't go through what the
speech is too much but as we at as he starts unfold his problem his
speech gets longer because he has a problem to describe.</span>  

\[41:23\] <span title="41:23 - 41:32">The more you speak the more
vulnerability the more the more the more you are vulnerable to
indecisive question why do you think that why do you say that these
kinds of questions.</span>  
<span title="41:32 - 41:35">And he's aware of that and so we have to get
himself in the position where you can say that.</span>  
<span title="41:36 - 41:49">And then what band is doing a short
sentences so we've gone from the short and long and veggies I'll just
show you this friends had a very powerful guy never had trouble dinner
with nothing now all of a sudden is like falling apart he cries for no
reason you can't sleep we come with friends,</span>  
<span title="41:49 - 42:01">be there again three different topic to you
he he gets nervous around me what to get away from these people as
normal as like it though I like your house is a taxi can't we just like
he has busy just been doing it's like he's going to die or
some.</span>  
<span title="42:01 - 42:08">The brain long rambling speech and been cut
it off panic attacks has been asserting is power.</span>  
<span title="42:08 - 42:22">Epic sax on a doctor I know what it is and
she doesn't like the most of panic because it implies that he's not in
control and then jumps up and said what's all you guys fucking panic
attacks one who said panic too he said panic 3 again it's another
free.</span>  
<span title="42:23 - 42:24">Presents it's going to be.</span>  
<span title="42:24 - 42:38">Thing and then been back backtracks not
panic dizzy chest breathing constricting attacks 3 reply is so late in
the Beat Of Three that the three accusing sentences get three excusing
replies from from Band wiki.</span>  
<span title="42:38 - 42:52">The now as we were playing the same song
another both beating and 3 so we had them is beats having a back to was
a now as a beginning to connect as characters a sentence with m a
beginning to come together and they're beating in the same way that it
is now it's relax.</span>  
<span title="42:52 - 42:57">Is it makes a big confession this guy wants
to know what he can do to make it stop.</span>  

\[42:58\] <span title="42:58 - 43:05">Again that's about centres centres
replies is mistabishi I'm gonna go out on a limb here I think your
friend is you know about the same length.</span>  
<span title="43:06 - 43:11">So we have he's got a short and long service
is it now he services I can equalising out this is a point with us in
it.</span>  
<span title="43:12 - 43:21">For the scene is going away from better cuz
he's so we'll what he wants and he's telling him as problem only wants
able to go to take charge and deal with it we didn't waste come in the
first place.</span>  
<span title="43:21 - 43:32">And then he says in I think your friend is
you and then the Sinker to pivots around and then there's a little bit
of messing around and then we get into the part where.</span>  
<span title="43:32 - 43:36">So what says ok well if you want to get to
router probably gonna need some some some sort of therapy.</span>  
<span title="43:37 - 43:51">That's the other game it's a long sentence
and lick it applies what with you or something short sentence so we're
going from the powerful person talking and short sentences to do with
her and then longer see said I mean it's gone to equal and now it's
turned around so now.</span>  

**Chas Fisher:**  
\[43:50\] <span title="43:50 - 44:02">Answer me the reason why is
working so well on that front is because the characters then when he
feels in control his feet longer when biddies be fielding control his
beats short it move it is speaking.</span>  
<span title="44:02 - 44:09">At long length is a slave vulnerability and
weakness where is he been speaking longer is his strength so they're
contra.</span>  

**Stu Willis:**  
\[44:09\] <span title="44:09 - 44:22">Interestingly probably the same
reasons that this idea that the more you speak the more you reveal Ben
speaks a lot because revealing' stuff and being insightful as his job
videos the op it is exactly that isn't reveal too much keep this
quiet.</span>  

\[44:22\] <span title="44:22 - 44:26">Cards question chest strikes
me.</span>  

\[44:26\] <span title="44:26 - 44:39">And you have any talk about this
rule rule of three but just how repetitive some of this dialogue is you
you if it's on the page you you've got to give my friend you got to give
oh yeah you got a fucking gift.</span>  
<span title="44:39 - 44:43">How many feet is very almost cliche De Niro
you talkin to me you talking to me.</span>  
<span title="44:43 - 44:53">But I guess maybe there is a sweet pea when
you're editing your own dialogue that you can sit down and cross out the
repetition because you like well we've already said the line that you
know.</span>  

\[44:53\] <span title="44:53 - 45:00">He's got a gift why do we need
wait you know a whole standard dialogue on it I think the rhythm things
here is kind of.</span>  
<span title="45:00 - 45:14">Tools for us to understand why maybe we've
got those in Tyler could be very instinctive on that first time you lay
it down but you writing that rhythm and some maybe you can released I
can over intellectualise and trim it back.</span>  

**Stephen Cleary:**  
\[45:15\] <span title="45:15 - 45:18">It is a trope in Italian American
characters they do tend repetitively,</span>  
<span title="45:18 - 45:33">you talking to me talk about kind of thing
it's answer degree part of the repetition as soon as to do the fact that
it's an Italian American Gangster character and the film is a kind of us
of a mocking parody of these kind of game ever in the dinner is playing
iconic character call me please have a characters played,</span>  
<span title="45:33 - 45:43">lots of lots of times there is that but it's
also absolutely true that there is an enormous amount of repetition of
words and again if you look at really powerful scenes dialogue.</span>  
<span title="45:43 - 45:57">That there is an exchange of words and that
again it is the way that you know you got a gift no I don't yes you do
know I don't use you do it back as a backwards and forwards it is going
on and the repetition the word is really important because the.</span>  
<span title="45:57 - 46:02">As the scene plays out movement the Dynamic
of power between the characters is moving around,</span>  
<span title="46:02 - 46:10">the way that a word is use and then repeated
as it it has it at 8 so has a similarity but a difference of emphasis a
different account.</span>  
<span title="46:11 - 46:19">So that I can you get this all the time and
and good screen record dialogue writing is it there the scenes turn the
rotate around wanted to keyword.</span>  
<span title="46:19 - 46:33">Those words are in a hour in Witcher Curtis

**Excerpts:**  
\[46:44\] <span title="46:44 - 46:55">What should we do book it
book.</span>  

## Remains Of The Day

\[46:57\] <span title="46:57 - 47:07">What's the book about you
know.</span>  

\[47:10\] <span title="47:10 - 47:16">Racing everything amazing
book.</span>  

\[47:19\] <span title="47:19 - 47:26">Getting crazy books to be found in
his lordships shows did it.</span>  

\[47:32\] <span title="47:32 - 47:43">Delete my lungs getting it's my
time.</span>  

\[47:44\] <span title="47:44 - 47:53">Send that book can't you see or
are you protecting me somewhere you're doing.</span>  

**Stephen Cleary:**  
\[48:05\] <span title="48:05 - 48:09">As the singing nun Falls book is
like her.</span>  
<span title="48:09 - 48:21">If I can correct that is past the twin at it
becomes full of sexual tension and and and symbolism and it's repeated
honestly in a Scene It's somewhat 42 times in a CNA bless them to
me.</span>  

\[48:22\] <span title="48:22 - 48:24">42 uses of the word book.</span>  

\[48:25\] <span title="48:25 - 48:34">In normal like nobody nobody talks
like that no one ever watches that Phil nobody watches at home and watch
is that CNN says no one talks like that.</span>  

\[48:35\] <span title="48:35 - 48:44">Ok because that's not the point
people don't they don't measure it by the but a normal stand as what
they understand is what a scene is telling him as if you want to know
how much is people desire each other.</span>  

\[48:45\] <span title="48:45 - 48:53">That what you want to know the
level of suppressed tension in the scene just look at how much they
flirt with the word book book just becomes just going to read leaving
the sound of it.</span>  

\[48:54\] <span title="48:54 - 48:56">This is like a tennis
match.</span>  
<span title="48:57 - 49:09">Bus was passing it to each other I need
something pass it is a little bit was slow and belonging I need oh and
the whole thing revolves around the exploration of the word book and
that's kind of like a poem.</span>  

**Chas Fisher:**  
\[49:10\] <span title="49:10 - 49:14">One of that you referred to
earlier when you were looking for.</span>  

\[49:15\] <span title="49:15 - 49:21">Something approved off in terms of
dialogue one of those don't do dialogue things that I've come across the
light is.</span>  

\[49:22\] <span title="49:22 - 49:31">Acheter know that you're seeing is
2 has too much exposition as you got one character asking questions on
character answering them all the time where is we see the
scene.</span>  
<span title="49:32 - 49:41">It's almost an exchange of questions
constantly questions and answers question answers but at no point does
it feel like exposition and partly is because they're not
talking.</span>  
<span title="49:41 - 49:53">About the plot really it's it's about in
it's what they're talking about so how do you know when you're using
like a good use of questions.</span>  

**Stephen Cleary:**  
\[49:53\] <span title="49:53 - 50:00">Because it is and he said ok if
you look this in it's OK let's look at it for the effective of the two
characters what is John vt1.</span>  

## Analyze This (Again)

\[50:01\] <span title="50:01 - 50:09">I don't fit he wants in the scene
to have someone help him because he's having a panic attack so what you
want but he wanted it and he's been recommended this.</span>  
<span title="50:09 - 50:13">Therapist so what John Vicky wants is this
therapist to make him better.</span>  
<span title="50:13 - 50:24">And then what does spent over $0.01
overwatch to get him out of the office is that a said he wants to have
nothing to do with them ok and no point in the sea indispensable talk
about what he wants.</span>  
<span title="50:24 - 50:38">Ok but you just understand straight away
from the moment John but he walks in they know that Ben wants a man of
that ok but the sea has powerful subject because we know what's under
the surface and wants to get him out and everything been is trying to do
is by getting into leave.</span>  
<span title="50:38 - 50:48">And we know what he wants which is
everything he's about is about getting himself in there and order to get
rid of one so that the of the they did the goals of the characters I'm
at Rocklea a PO.</span>  
<span title="50:49 - 50:54">And the lovely consequence of the scene is
that Ben eventually gets what he wants.</span>  

\[50:55\] <span title="50:55 - 51:01">Methi leaves as he leaves but he
said two things are first of all I'm not going to put his my
therapist.</span>  
<span title="51:01 - 51:07">Short term goal to get in a way that is
Alice in a long term result of him being his therapist.</span>  
<span title="51:07 - 51:16">Which show is tied to this man in a way that
he would visit living nightmare for him second thing as he leaves them
but he said to me know FIFA.</span>  
<span title="51:16 - 51:21">If you if I talk to you and you make me into
a flag I'm gonna kill you you understand so.</span>  
<span title="51:21 - 51:34">The line it comes back with issues with a
gun because the lines about equal can we define flag because of emotions
make up a while you gotta feel something and if you feel anything that
you think that means you're a fag that I'm in trouble.</span>  

**Stu Willis:**  
\[51:34\] <span title="51:34 - 51:43">A permanent Bunnings simple I go
bag dude I got it and I'm in a response I meant was going to point out
cos it's interesting as a few of these.</span>  
<span title="51:43 - 51:52">There is no dialogue lines end with
questions that are like you understand yeah like they turn a statement
into a question.</span>  

\[51:52\] <span title="51:52 - 51:53">For the other.</span>  

**Stephen Cleary:**  
\[51:53\] <span title="51:53 - 52:01">With John vichie this thing my
questions is that John vichie it's it's always about it's it's about
affirmation power I'm telling it is do you understand me.</span>  
<span title="52:01 - 52:10">And it's like I'm your full single account
so I understand you and it's always about submission is forcing the
character in a submissive position and this is what people with power do
it again.</span>  
<span title="52:10 - 52:15">Given the tears who is this it has to be
constructive questions because that's how these people are.</span>  
<span title="52:16 - 52:24">And if you don't have an actor understanding
of how someone with power coerce is other people to obey them it's a bad
constant reaffirmation of it.</span>  
<span title="52:24 - 52:31">Everytime I ask a question he he knows full
well this person just did it's not about did you really understand me
what the question is about is.</span>  
<span title="52:32 - 52:45">I demand now but you need to find me a
superior now it's worse yes I understand and that means yes I'm you know
I'm doing what you want me to do and that's all about the underlying
subject of status which is really what's going on in this scene is
like.</span>  
<span title="52:46 - 52:50">How can a very high status individual reveal
vulnerability.</span>  
<span title="52:51 - 52:56">Because of reactive relieving buildability
is across the latest movie was that your lowest it lowers your
status.</span>  
<span title="52:57 - 53:09">So how come this hi Stacey did you get into
a room and escape is what he's thinking having revealed own ability hi
having low it is stated and the way you do that is your cost to post a
status down of the person that you're with.</span>  
<span title="53:10 - 53:12">So will that I may be going lower you're
going to lower still.</span>  
<span title="53:12 - 53:20">But the same time to trouble though that he
has he has to have Max her I said hi enough status to be comfortable
enough to be a psychiatrist.</span>  
<span title="53:20 - 53:23">Because if you're the beginning of the scene
please don't kill me.</span>  
<span title="53:23 - 53:31">You know he's not you not being a
psychiatrist cause he's in his like when he says Max it's all it says
you know I do like Tony Bennett.</span>  

\[53:31\] <span title="53:31 - 53:40">His reply as a pencil place I love
this much everyone in the whole scene I like all Italian saying it is it
for you to lie I will like.</span>  

**Stu Willis:**  
\[53:40\] <span title="53:40 - 53:44">And then it's funny because the
whole thing is it's exactly what are you QS Carlo.</span>  

\[53:44\] <span title="53:44 - 53:57">I can't you always submit to
anything everyone with secondary character in very violent secondary
character illuminates that half the same because you could've had them
almost.</span>  
<span title="53:57 - 54:03">Walking in the sand beginning with m just
walking in on the assassin with no set up but that set up actually has
pale.</span>  

**Stephen Cleary:**  
\[54:03\] <span title="54:03 - 54:11">Set to make the sea work wasn't
about to talk about the beginning you have to have the right to know two
things first what's going on with the characters so what are the
dramatic element.</span>  
<span title="54:11 - 54:24">Well in this see this character wants this
thing there is this character who is this other character this character
to do this this is a stated position this is a stage 3 from the other
character how the stages will move to the same just have a power move
all of those things are going to watch the underlying,</span>  
<span title="54:24 - 54:30">has a dramatic narrative that we're doing
live and on top of that it is ok what is the music of John bit.</span>  
<span title="54:30 - 54:40">This is why I would I would say that you
know when you when you think about writing dialogue is an aspect of
character which is for me is that each character has their own
Sam.</span>  
<span title="54:41 - 54:43">And that sounded expressed in the weather
doll at work.</span>  
<span title="54:43 - 54:58">Answer your creating music so you say k John
vichie plays himself if I don't talk to them soundtrack and this is what
it is and it's for the threes and repetitions and questions and that's
kind of the way that we design.</span>  
<span title="54:58 - 55:05">I designed to cynically what is the weather
we arrived at the sort of music of John Betty and then make
soba.</span>  
<span title="55:05 - 55:08">Is is is is on the other side Max so we'll
talk in longer sentence.</span>  

\[55:09\] <span title="55:09 - 55:16">You know what I'm more qualifying
causes give it a chance when he's right he will become quite voluble bit
see when he's relax doesn't talk.</span>  

\[55:16\] <span title="55:16 - 55:26">Just what I misses me and that's
the difference I know I'm whatever situation there and they may be
required put more or less given the dynamics of the scene but the
natural music is that.</span>  
<span title="55:26 - 55:33">You know Max will tend to use longer words
with you use short words that will tend to use qualifying adjectives
Vicki Wilson to use no magic.</span>  
<span title="55:34 - 55:40">This this is kind of honesty understanding
now some people with a great deal and right as they just know
that.</span>  

**Chas Fisher:**  
\[55:39\] <span title="55:39 - 55:42">They don't even have
Samoa.</span>  

**Stephen Cleary:**  
\[55:41\] <span title="55:41 - 55:49">Better think about the music it's
kinda natural do that and that's why the Daleks am really so well it
sounds so good but other writers.</span>  
<span title="55:49 - 55:53">You can just because you don't naturally
hurt this is what you learn.</span>  
<span title="55:53 - 56:02">Again the more practice you do the way we
think about this and we write whatever the better your instinct is for
understanding that so when you come to create new characters in a
story,</span>  
<span title="56:02 - 56:11">6 Mustang Eleanor you down the line you
already we're thinking subconscious about the music will start to write
this characters with their voices without with the other side which I
think is a kind of.</span>  
<span title="56:11 - 56:26">I think it's character with underscore and
if you look at certain very prominent as a characters you can see that
you know when you know when you look in there are you talking to me that
kind of character or if you look at the you know Richard Curtis Hugh
Grant romantic male character.</span>

\[58:22\] <span title="58:22 - 58:26">The thing is the thing
is.</span>

about it go away immediately go away sorry.</span>  

\[58:42\] <span title="58:42 - 58:48">You were saying.</span>  

\[58:51\] <span title="58:51 - 58:56">Go away today but I wondered if I
didn't.</span>  

\[58:58\] <span title="58:58 - 59:05">You might let me see you a little
or maybe.</span>  

\[59:08\] <span title="59:08 - 59:16">If you could like me again but
yesterday the actor asked you who I was you just dismissed me out of
it.</span>  

\[59:21\] <span title="59:21 - 59:29">How to microphone on Mac.</span>  

\[59:30\] <span title="59:30 - 59:34">Excuse me it's your mother on the
phone.</span>  

\[59:38\] <span title="59:38 - 59:50">How many tell her I'll bring it
back safely tried that time but you said you said that once before it
snowed in about 24 hours and the first person blackish in colouring
right right yeah.</span>  
<span title="59:51 - 1:00:01">Perfect timing is over number for a
second.</span>  

\[1:00:05\] <span title="1:00:05 - 1:00:12">I just say I thought Ghosts
was the most wonderful film.</span>  

\[1:00:14\] <span title="1:00:14 - 1:00:18">It's alright yes.</span>  

\[1:00:20\] <span title="1:00:20 - 1:00:27">I've always wondered what oh
what Patrick Swayze is like in in in real life.</span>  

\[1:00:28\] <span title="1:00:28 - 1:00:39">I can't say that I Neil
Patrick on Packer what do you want from me well I'm sure he's friendly
to do me more who acted with him in girls.</span>  

\[1:00:43\] <span title="1:00:43 - 1:00:45">Oh right sorry.</span>  

\[1:00:47\] <span title="1:00:47 - 1:01:01">We've been a bit of an ass
oh well it was underneath.</span>  

\[1:01:04\] <span title="1:01:04 - 1:01:05">Sorry.</span>  

\[1:01:07\] <span title="1:01:07 - 1:01:16">So is a pass on jury guys
have to consider their verdict.</span>  

\[1:01:18\] <span title="1:01:18 - 1:01:27">I'm a very level headed
bloke not often ran out of the house butter.</span>  

\[1:01:31\] <span title="1:01:31 - 1:01:38">Play to say no to your kind
request let me know.</span>  

\[1:01:42\] <span title="1:01:42 - 1:01:51">Hi math course I
guys.</span>  

\[1:01:53\] <span title="1:01:53 - 1:01:58">What's been going on then
it's nice to see you.</span>  

\[1:01:59\] <span title="1:01:59 - 1:02:09">With you I'm in real danger
it seems like a perfect situation but that file Temple of your
butt.</span>  

\[1:02:10\] <span title="1:02:10 - 1:02:17">My relatively inexperienced
how would I fear not recover I was.</span>  
<span title="1:02:17 - 1:02:29">Once again cast aside as I would
absolutely expect to be there just too many pictures of you too many how
are you go and I'd be.</span>  

\[1:02:30\] <span title="1:02:30 - 1:02:32">Well bucket.</span>  

\[1:02:34\] <span title="1:02:34 - 1:02:46">It really has real nowadays
I live in Notting Hill you live in Beverly Hills who won the world knows
who you are my mother has trouble remembering my name.</span>  

\[1:02:48\] <span title="1:02:48 - 1:02:56">Time to see.</span>  

\[1:03:00\] <span title="1:03:00 - 1:03:08">Same thing isn't really real
you know don't forget.</span>  

\[1:03:11\] <span title="1:03:11 - 1:03:16">Muscle just a girl standing
in front of a boy.</span>  

\[1:03:19\] <span title="1:03:19 - 1:03:24">Love.</span>  

**Stu Willis:**  
\[1:03:24\] <span title="1:03:24 - 1:03:31">We're going to 90 hell I'm
just gonna make a flight aggression I'm into this I think.</span>  

**Chas Fisher:**  
\[1:03:30\] <span title="1:03:30 - 1:03:34">You doing hh as you like
smacking the Segway down.</span>  

**Stu Willis:**  
\[1:03:33\] <span title="1:03:33 - 1:03:41">Yeah I know let me finish
which is cause I was almost going to drive into the same comment about
questions as you from a different perspective.</span>  

\[1:03:42\] <span title="1:03:42 - 1:03:47">Right which is when I was
doing improv one of the things that you were taught in improv is no
question.</span>  

\[1:03:47\] <span title="1:03:47 - 1:03:53">The idea that because it's
an improv thing naturally people will.</span>  

\[1:03:53\] <span title="1:03:53 - 1:04:01">Shoot down the reality of
the saying that you're crying I create by asking questions oh my god
we're on the moon why are we on the moon.</span>  

\[1:04:01\] <span title="1:04:01 - 1:04:08">And like to see me fall flat
where is if you get rid of questions people have to accept the reality
of the world that your building.</span>  
<span title="1:04:08 - 1:04:15">It's a technique that I've occasionally
done when I struggled with saying is I sit there and try to rewrite it
where it's like.</span>  
<span title="1:04:15 - 1:04:27">The opposite of a game of questions it's
a game of statements and how does the scene feel if gamer statements and
such.</span>  

\[1:04:28\] <span title="1:04:28 - 1:04:37">Answer each other but
there's other moments were it's in for me that's like other three
interesting if this character is compelled to say something and there's
no question to leave them.</span>  

**Chas Fisher:**  
\[1:04:37\] <span title="1:04:37 - 1:04:47">But depends on the on the on
the power status when I saw the opening episode of season 3 of Please
Like Me last night witch.</span>  
<span title="1:04:47 - 1:04:56">Fantastic I really love it but there's a
3 way Skype conversation between these three friends and these taking
turns to say sentences.</span>  
<span title="1:04:56 - 1:05:05">But it's them telling their own story or
possibly ask me a question but is totally unrelated to the line that
went before is basically rebuilding 3 very self involved
people.</span>  
<span title="1:05:05 - 1:05:15">Talking in the same room but not having
a conversation really and but that's because they all have equal status
and they all feel very comfortable with each other and that's
that.</span>  
<span title="1:05:15 - 1:05:24">Dynamics so you're saying something by
having the lack of questions and the lack of involvement but they're all
just dance would have spouting at each other where is this
scene.</span>  
<span title="1:05:24 - 1:05:35">The questions are all about letting you
get from that like that from the structural point of view of how to get
a man terrified for his life to take on a mobster for therapy.</span>  
<span title="1:05:35 - 1:05:37">And you need questions in
there.</span>  

**Stu Willis:**  
\[1:05:36\] <span title="1:05:36 - 1:05:47">And giving me a Segway it
into Nottinghill haven't got it's initial in contrast with Anna and
William because they don't ask questions as much they are kind of
finishing.</span>  
<span title="1:05:47 - 1:05:53">Even if you just look on the page
there's a lot of ellipsis is there's a lot of people that kind of
picking up with the other one.</span>  

\[1:05:53\] <span title="1:05:53 - 1:06:04">Let's go they don't need
maybe it's because I'm in it's so late in the film I'm awake and have
her famous saying and maybe that's why.</span>  

\[1:06:05\] <span title="1:06:05 - 1:06:18">I mean that's interesting
looking at specific with example in my hair I'll say I was trying to
rewrite it the same without questions and it didn't work it's because it
was the oak like one of the early scenes were introduced to our
characters you need them to guardians in here.</span>  
<span title="1:06:18 - 1:06:21">Searching for a feeling a lot of
character I guess.</span>  

**Chas Fisher:**  
\[1:06:21\] <span title="1:06:21 - 1:06:27">And but they're on as equal
footing and say it's at the end of the film I've done there.</span>  

**Stephen Cleary:**  
\[1:06:28\] <span title="1:06:28 - 1:06:37">Yeah this is a dynamically I
mean in terms of status it's it's interesting because you have this
incredibly famous person.</span>  
<span title="1:06:37 - 1:06:50">Coming to the house sorted this the
workplace of an incredibly a insignificant person but the point is that
is the reverse list of this incredibly famous person has actually come
to clear a love to the cuddly.</span>  
<span title="1:06:50 - 1:06:59">Then to the Moon entities that is a huge
going to underline a reversal here and at the same time they have
to.</span>  

\[1:07:00\] <span title="1:07:00 - 1:07:05">They have to negotiate a
point where she feels comfortable enough to say what she has to
say.</span>  
<span title="1:07:06 - 1:07:13">So again it's like this this woman has
come into this man and she's about to tell him that she did she loves
him and she wants to be with them.</span>  
<span title="1:07:13 - 1:07:27">And so but it's not what point does a
parrot to like her feel comfortable enough to do that it's not
innocently just Comfort it's also a what point is is the issue comes up
on the scene which is almost running out of time.</span>  
<span title="1:07:28 - 1:07:37">Well you know she can't mess around with
very much longer at the what's awesome thing about this scene I think
it's something that Richard Curtis is a lot is that the
language.</span>  

\[1:07:38\] <span title="1:07:38 - 1:07:47">I think about a love story
is it as we all know these kind of romance is the fact is they love each
other when they see eachother the whole story and it is a big problem of
writing romance is,</span>  
<span title="1:07:47 - 1:07:55">create a series of manufactured
circumstances the stop the people from being together that's really the
big problem romance writer is,</span>  
<span title="1:07:55 - 1:08:08">you know she comes to his house
beginning of a filament she goes out and she comes back massage cause
she left the bag that and she suddenly jumps on it she kisses and what
you obviously feel things very powerful for him and then the next time
season 2 of myself to dinner and kisses in the park.</span>  
<span title="1:08:08 - 1:08:12">So she obviously really loves it or love
it has fallen for him.</span>  
<span title="1:08:12 - 1:08:27">So that the promise I'll be stop them I
didn't stop into going away this is what he got we like eachother should
we go out and then it would we get married on yeah OK so you have to the
plaza get in the way this is the interesting the characters have an
inbuilt as a word.</span>  
<span title="1:08:27 - 1:08:29">Destiny which is that they are going to
be together.</span>  

**Chas Fisher:**  
\[1:08:29\] <span title="1:08:29 - 1:08:36">Anything part of the pot and
get some way can be the characters of the carrots have to get over
elements of themselves in order for them to be together.</span>  

**Stephen Cleary:**  
\[1:08:35\] <span title="1:08:35 - 1:08:47">I have a baby have to have
to overcome you know a series of external if that was on then famously
in the could have second half a second at those into a local schools
come out but if that in a funny way because this is a run.</span>  
<span title="1:08:48 - 1:08:57">Because it's going to be generic a part
of the structure that we all know they are destined to be together no
one seriously think that any point in a story that these people are
going to be together.</span>  
<span title="1:08:57 - 1:09:02">So the couple is already together it's
just a question of how long it takes to work it out to realise.</span>  
<span title="1:09:02 - 1:09:16">I need these kinds of stories very often
which occurred is has the language of the dialling the characters of the
lovers already exchanging already been raised self-similar so that the
way they talk to each other using the same kind of were the same kind of
Pentacles drug.</span>  
<span title="1:09:16 - 1:09:20">The same kind of a Camry even though
they're not together the languages together.</span>  
<span title="1:09:20 - 1:09:33">And it kind of in some says undercuts
for the characters are doing is a character as it's like carefully
trying not to be together because you're not bad to admit things all
those circles I say stop in them but they language saying all the time
these two people are in the same Perth.</span>  

**Chas Fisher:**  
\[1:09:33\] <span title="1:09:33 - 1:09:36">Are you talking about at
this end point of the film.</span>  

**Stephen Cleary:**  
\[1:09:36\] <span title="1:09:36 - 1:09:46">Even at the even at the
beginning it is is is lesser but at the longer the story goes on the
more you see this going to pack is a speech that there's a line in the
scene where Anna says.</span>  
<span title="1:09:46 - 1:09:56">Hey he she has have you been and William
says everything much the same when they changed it was bike and I'll
marry me titli where is you have watched a wonder awards Glory and she
replies.</span>  
<span title="1:09:56 - 1:10:02">Oh no it's all nonsense believe me I had
no idea how much nonsense it was but nonsense it all is.</span>  

\[1:10:03\] <span title="1:10:03 - 1:10:12">There is no American in a
world that would ever use a sentence but no sense at all is OK this is
it this is William this is William Tyler she talking like him.</span>  

**Chas Fisher:**  
\[1:10:12\] <span title="1:10:12 - 1:10:23">Minivan just looking at the
page the Anna part has a lot more ellipses in it has a lot more Hugh
Grant pauses and stuff has and rephrasing.</span>  

**Stephen Cleary:**  
\[1:10:23\] <span title="1:10:23 - 1:10:32">Because you know the reason
it Hugh Grant famously and all these films are stuck as in pauses
because the character never is not admitting the truth of themselves
that's the Carrie.</span>  
<span title="1:10:32 - 1:10:41">How many phone's were the car trimester
treat themselves they get married this talking shortis and season 2
films and things become more direct and it's really
interesting.</span>  

**Chas Fisher:**  
\[1:10:41\] <span title="1:10:41 - 1:10:46">Love it if that's the
synopsis of this story they speak in short sentences and they get
married Mister Fitz.</span>  

**Stephen Cleary:**  
\[1:10:46\] <span title="1:10:46 - 1:10:55">The point that they the
reason is bigger Longer senses because not speaking the truth and this
ends when the characters actually speak the truth their language
simplifier.</span>  
<span title="1:10:55 - 1:11:07">And as soon as I stop that stop lying to
other people or to themselves whether an emotional response is the
language becomes complex the language it like in these stories Richie
Curtis Skepta if the language like a smoke screen.</span>  
<span title="1:11:07 - 1:11:15">Is what I can't he doesn't want anyone
to know what they're feeling they speak a lot when they want to say what
they're feeling on their honest.</span>  

\[1:11:15\] <span title="1:11:15 - 1:11:20">The amount of words they say
and the way it's constructed become much simpler.</span>  

**Stu Willis:**  
\[1:11:20\] <span title="1:11:20 - 1:11:30">Yet look at Anna's Kyogle
justifications why she brought the painting which is Jenny my apartment
in New York I just thought you would but when it came to it I didn't
know how you.</span>  
<span title="1:11:30 - 1:11:40">Adding that so badly twice I'm in a
total Hugh Grant speech but it is her kind and justifying it basically I
came out with an excuse to come and see you.</span>  
<span title="1:11:40 - 1:11:53">By giving you a really expensive
regional but it's also Amy needs a visual example of the very thing you
talking about she saw him having a print of that painting so she's
bought him the original.</span>  
<span title="1:11:53 - 1:12:01">To build a connection between them
William responds to Anna with what's the thing and it's ties into what
you're saying about the thing.</span>  

**Stephen Cleary:**  
\[1:12:02\] <span title="1:12:02 - 1:12:10">Other thing thing thing is
from get your thing and it's late and this is again this is Anna if you
look at the construction of the next thing says the thing is
pause.</span>  

\[1:12:11\] <span title="1:12:11 - 1:12:18">Change of emphasis I have to
go way too but it wondered if I didn't whether you might let me see you
a bit or a lot maybe see if you could like me again.</span>  
<span title="1:12:19 - 1:12:27">This is this kind of you should not what
she should say or what you know what we know exactly what you understand
I love you I want to be with you that's all she needs.</span>  

\[1:12:28\] <span title="1:12:28 - 1:12:34">But because she's not yet at
the point in a seamless you have the courage to say precisely what she
want.</span>  
<span title="1:12:34 - 1:12:41">You, suggesting and then William again
it's just that they reply but yesterday that actress who I was,</span>  
<span title="1:12:41 - 1:12:45">are you dismissed out of hand I heard
you had a microphone I had headphones,</span>  
<span title="1:12:45 - 1:12:59">this is gonna call me under and kind of
conversation then and it comes in with this line you expect me to tell
the truth about my life to the most indiscreet man and England by that's
the truth is an actress who knows that you can't say things I'm going to
leave because,</span>  
<span title="1:12:59 - 1:13:00">your life can be made a mess
of.</span>  

\[1:13:01\] <span title="1:13:01 - 1:13:10">Imported no complexity it's
like a simple site is extremely direct cause she's talking to true then
we have a it's interesting in this in another interruption.</span>  
<span title="1:13:10 - 1:13:17">In the same way in the previous seem you
looked at you have a like a prelude which is the beginning of the guide
been treated by.</span>  
<span title="1:13:17 - 1:13:22">Call before you want Vicky comes in in
this scene we have a message really I think again.</span>  

\[1:13:23\] <span title="1:13:23 - 1:13:34">Interesting because you if
you ask the question why is this in reckon is such a way where you have
it's a very chatty saying there's a lot of Dialogue in it I'm and quite
a lot of it scene is taken up with this.</span>  
<span title="1:13:34 - 1:13:39">Defeat assistant who is kind of slutty
awkward and a ghost.</span>  

\[1:13:40\] <span title="1:13:40 - 1:13:45">Making fun of lots of
mistakes and partly it's because this thing is so sweet.</span>  

\[1:13:45\] <span title="1:13:45 - 1:13:57">30. Sit flat and no it's
almost impossible to write because waiting for you not one lover coming
to another level if you don't Shakespeare you know just to get through
this thing without me what it's going past with a sick bag.</span>  
<span title="1:13:57 - 1:14:00">It's really really hard because it's all
gone.</span>  
<span title="1:14:00 - 1:14:08">You know so so so so part me it's like
where's the lemon when how do I put a twist in the scene and I wanted to
give it a bit of a different.</span>  
<span title="1:14:08 - 1:14:20">Undertaken to dilute the sugar and so he
does it with this kind of like the tonic water if you like and the scene
is it character he just has a number stupid things and there's another
interrupting character it was the customer comes early he throws
out.</span>  

**Stu Willis:**  
\[1:14:20\] <span title="1:14:20 - 1:14:31">And that I was going to ring
and ups it's really interesting because Anna is rambling and William
when the Mr Smith comes in Williamsburg strapped into the truth just
don't even think about it go away immediately.</span>  

**Chas Fisher:**  
\[1:14:31\] <span title="1:14:31 - 1:14:37">For the interruption happens
right as William says what's the thing like you did her too.</span>  

**Stu Willis:**  
\[1:14:36\] <span title="1:14:36 - 1:14:51">I want to hear the answer it
showed that he wants her to stay and he's been busy can only give the
truth to that customer which is in a piss off I hear what she has to say
and so over here it's Cuz it's one of those little moments meant to eat
a great laugh.</span>  

\[1:14:51\] <span title="1:14:51 - 1:14:59">But it reveals character and
reveals that he has his under the underlying desire to hear what Anna
has to say.</span>  
<span title="1:14:59 - 1:15:04">Even his breath saying we're breaking up
well wake me up I don't want to see yours going to say.</span>  

**Chas Fisher:**  
\[1:15:04\] <span title="1:15:04 - 1:15:06">But this is also
have.</span>  

\[1:15:06\] <span title="1:15:06 - 1:15:16">And put something it's
something that you said to me a long time ago Steven but it stayed with
me is that when you actually have a character say their true if I say
something without some text they actually relinquish power to.</span>  
<span title="1:15:17 - 1:15:26">Often take you over there talking to him
we saw it in there a billion backs at Ben's Sobel seen just before bow
and sober when he says please don't kill me.</span>  
<span title="1:15:26 - 1:15:32">Quick giving up power to committee by
saying that and then when MIDI admits that he wants.</span>  
<span title="1:15:32 - 1:15:46">Therapy he's giving power back to Max
and it's the same thing here that is soon is a Anna actually gets to the
truth of what you saying and seen that that's when William has all the
power and they seem to say.</span>  

**Stephen Cleary:**  
\[1:15:47\] <span title="1:15:47 - 1:15:52">And say what you're doing if
you write this in first they actually states the big scene so you know
you don't want to waste.</span>  
<span title="1:15:52 - 1:15:57">Awesome sweetie hard to ride is so not a
not make it to Sweet because it's really just a love
decoration.</span>  
<span title="1:15:58 - 1:16:12">Young this little guy who interruption
that allows on everything to the rhythm of it because we have William
and then come in and it's little bit you know Dum Dee Dum Dee Dum is
hazardous sentence and he replies in the same way,</span>  
<span title="1:16:12 - 1:16:15">and then we have this little man
Martin.</span>  
<span title="1:16:15 - 1:16:24">The comes out again when he's talking
about he said he said your mum's on the phone and and William Hugh Grant
leaves and then we have this little exchange money which is,</span>  
<span title="1:16:24 - 1:16:31">can I just say it go to the wonderful
film is that right as I know yes I've always wondered what Patrick
Swayze is like in real life.</span>  
<span title="1:16:31 - 1:16:37">I can't send a package all that well how
dare he wasn't ready to fill me suddenly we got sentence we got
questions.</span>  
<span title="1:16:37 - 1:16:50">Mercator Evanna story and it's either
hasn't got short work shorts and has his question response questions 1
and suddenly the rhythm and seen pics up so we had this kind of two
people can have like meandering because they not able to direct approach
the tree.</span>  
<span title="1:16:50 - 1:16:52">And then we have more to be an
idiot.</span>  
<span title="1:16:52 - 1:17:02">But he wants to know something straight
forward it and answer the sensibly goes dump dump dump dump truck
through to the pace of 18 picks up with dialogue is driving the scene
forward.</span>  
<span title="1:17:02 - 1:17:11">And then we get out of that then as it
is a funny gag line because he has made it mistakenly no it's not it's
not too it's not under his talk about away and then.</span>  

\[1:17:11\] <span title="1:17:11 - 1:17:17">My tea leaves and William
comes back and it's like we restart a scene and it's really getting that
it.</span>  
<span title="1:17:18 - 1:17:24">This this decision to the writer is made
to throw in this series a funny line.</span>  
<span title="1:17:24 - 1:17:32">Which are short and abbreviated so we
can it's a picked up the going to commit Rhythm of the Sea take us away
from the sweetness of the ramon.</span>  
<span title="1:17:32 - 1:17:40">I brought it back as to where he is a
romantic comedy and this scene is divide into romance and comedy and so
we know we have the romance that we go to the comedy to go back to the
Romance.</span>  
<span title="1:17:41 - 1:17:54">I'm under snow comedy in 1 hour and we
were talking about there's no, it is no laughing and what they're saying
but you know there's the humour in the middle Unley humour is
abbreviated and fast so we drive as seen through and then we get it on
again when he comes out.</span>  
<span title="1:17:54 - 1:18:05">Anna is asleep so sorry about that and I
know it says again quite straightforward when she's waiting she was
nobody's going to say to it when she said you know I want to be with you
that's fine is always a pause one of your ready comes goes out I said
rates per day.</span>  
<span title="1:18:06 - 1:18:13">And then Williams reply and again it's
look at what he's not telling the truth to himself and that's the point
look at his dialogue Anna look.</span>  
<span title="1:18:14 - 1:18:22">I'm a very level headed bloke not often
and out of love but can I just say no to your kind request and leave it
at that.</span>  

**Chas Fisher:**  
\[1:18:22\] <span title="1:18:22 - 1:18:29">When you missed out what he
says and what it says in the big print or educators as the read it I
can't really Express water kefir.</span>  

**Stephen Cleary:**  
\[1:18:29\] <span title="1:18:29 - 1:18:34">I just like the reason he
can't express what he feels is because he's lying what he
feels.</span>  
<span title="1:18:35 - 1:18:43">Is it here now so this is the whole
point they didn't have the point of this scene is that as we know he's
destined to be with her ok lists of love is working on him but he's not
admitting it.</span>  
<span title="1:18:43 - 1:18:52">Because of his own preoccupation his own
past and his inability to have a successful least it women at cypress it
there a good strong character reasons for resuscitation.</span>  
<span title="1:18:52 - 1:19:00">But his dialogue is casting around for a
Canon routes drifting can I just say no to a kind request and leave it
at that.</span>  
<span title="1:19:00 - 1:19:05">Drifting meandering kind of
sentence.</span>  
<span title="1:19:06 - 1:19:16">Kingaroy wrong and only says yes that's
fine that under toes of course I you know of course I'll just that I
choose staggered because he turned it down so this is just a good day is
this.</span>  
<span title="1:19:16 - 1:19:25">And this is what the truth is OK it's
not about truth is about to give her a list of.</span>  

\[1:19:25\] <span title="1:19:25 - 1:19:27">Excuses.</span>  
<span title="1:19:27 - 1:19:41">That he's making for not being able to
cope with a fact that she makes him feel very strongly about things that
have been so cut off from the world for so long the fact that she makes
it for him she makes him feel emotionally alive and then the
dollar.</span>  
<span title="1:19:41 - 1:19:49">Expressing that the truth is with you
I'm in real danger it looks like a favour situation apart from that file
Temple you wasn't but and this is the key phrase listen to
this.</span>  
<span title="1:19:49 - 1:19:57">But my relatively and experienced hard
would I say not recover if I was once again cast aside which I would
absolutely expect to be.</span>  
<span title="1:19:57 - 1:20:05">OK how often it it ever seen a line like
that and it's 4 in it hurt and a screenplay ok it's like done and then
it's beautiful because.</span>  
<span title="1:20:06 - 1:20:14">It's a bogus you know it's just nonsense
and it's just the way that the sentences constructed the order just goes
this is bullshit isn't it.</span>  
<span title="1:20:14 - 1:20:19">I know this is not as he's just this
whatever he's saying he's lying it's just not true.</span>  
<span title="1:20:19 - 1:20:25">I'm a relatively inexperienced how he's
talking about love we talk about it as strong powerful emotions that the
finalize,</span>  
<span title="1:20:25 - 1:20:32">my anybody says my router in sweet how
would I fear not recover if I was once again cast aside he's talking
like.</span>  
<span title="1:20:32 - 1:20:42">And I like an 18th century is like Buddy
Sheridan you know it's not easy not talking like a modern person is is
avoiding everything and the dialogue is at as a complete
smokescreen.</span>  
<span title="1:20:42 - 1:20:55">You'll be going I'd be buggered
basically I see and then she said they said then he goes into a series
of again quit rhythm I live in Notting Hill you'll in Beverly Hills ever
in the world knows who you are my mother has trouble remembering my name
because he's talking couplet.</span>  
<span title="1:20:55 - 1:20:58">It did.</span>  

**Stu Willis:**  
\[1:20:57\] <span title="1:20:57 - 1:21:10">Even buggered basically I
mean that the alliteration and the repetition and that's and it's a
great way got all that rambly thing and then the short sounds of the
buggered basically can't top capital tops it whatever you want it
is.</span>  

**Stephen Cleary:**  
\[1:21:10\] <span title="1:21:10 - 1:21:13">I just said ok fine fine
good decision she said,</span>  
<span title="1:21:13 - 1:21:25">good decision is one of these are
repeated phrases that you get it again off and then it's been writing
dialogue good to see the line good decision on the phrase but it said
occurs about 4 times and Notting Hill a different Point.</span>  
<span title="1:21:25 - 1:21:40">Yo the last time understood good
decision was when she was in her hotel room and she taken William back
to her room to have sex with him and her boyfriend expect we turned it
from America and he said hey I've done it from Meraki unexpectedly is
that a good decision or not only went yes good decision.</span>  
<span title="1:21:40 - 1:21:51">The last time she said those words good
decision so Nicki Minaj story wonder if a good decision comes out again
the right Russell one of them in my dialogue what are the lines the
words are going to use it chemotherapy.</span>  
<span title="1:21:51 - 1:22:02">Did you want to go OK that's a man in
his notice over the last time she said good decision would be good
pivotal moments in the emotional evolution of an escort in the
film,</span>  
<span title="1:22:02 - 1:22:06">become like either milestones in there
in a moment of the story.</span>  

**Stu Willis:**  
\[1:22:06\] <span title="1:22:06 - 1:22:15">And it's Echo by William
sprint Bella not long after like actually next play The Script when
she's like good decision or actress is a mad at snakes.</span>  
<span title="1:22:15 - 1:22:17">And I think he.</span>  

\[1:22:18\] <span title="1:22:18 - 1:22:28">And then William and that
subsequent same with it I've made the wrong decision I haven't I mean
this is all pretty obvious to the audience is no.</span>  

**Stephen Cleary:**  
\[1:22:28\] <span title="1:22:28 - 1:22:38">It's 4 but that's it because
it so caught up in the characters in the story but when you go back
again you didn't say it was sending it finishes very famously
with.</span>  

\[1:22:39\] <span title="1:22:39 - 1:22:48">The absolute Simplicity of
what Anna says the same thing isn't really real you know don't forget
I'm also just a girl standing in front of a boy asked him to love
her.</span>  
<span title="1:22:49 - 1:22:50">If asleep,</span>  
<span title="1:22:50 - 1:22:59">it's in threes I'm also just a girl
standing in front of a boy asking for love her the dead letter to the
editor the delayed at the moment,</span>  
<span title="1:22:59 - 1:23:08">ok it's poetry ok you know any sense
that you don't from moment think that the writer hasn't aware of the
stresses of the syllables that you when you when you when you say
that.</span>  
<span title="1:23:08 - 1:23:15">Ok sweets is in threes and it's the same
as a syllable stress of the site I'm also just a girl standing in front
of a boy asking to love me.</span>  
<span title="1:23:15 - 1:23:26">Frozen part of the rent people got a
wireless great that line that is a killer line in the cinema when it
first comes out it will go whenever the power of it.</span>  
<span title="1:23:26 - 1:23:29">It's not just that she's speaking Street
full to the truth.</span>  
<span title="1:23:29 - 1:23:39">That's exactly what she is and so at
this absolutely pivotal moment in her life the character make the
simplest description possible about cheers but it's also rhythmically
Eleanor.</span>  

\[1:23:39\] <span title="1:23:39 - 1:23:48">Elegance to the construction
of a dialogue the match is that going to sincerity and truthfulness of
what she's saying and that together and I see the point.</span>  
<span title="1:23:48 - 1:23:55">Ate his constructed to seen in a
beautiful way to make the can a resident final only going to kill a line
work in the way that it needs to.</span>  
<span title="1:23:55 - 1:24:04">But he's also that's the underlying
stuff we talking about you've got out the structure and you're going to
know what you're doing in the scene but when you can get to the line you
got to have a beauty and the Waves written.</span>  
<span title="1:24:04 - 1:24:18">That's not to do with the underlying
stuff that's ok what words do I choose what rhythm do they have now
simple or complex Ave how does a punctuation with all those different
come together and then you have this going to line which you know it's
cliche now so what's a warning you,</span>  
<span title="1:24:18 - 1:24:19">you know.</span>  
<span title="1:24:19 - 1:24:29">I have played romantic comedies so same
as for the week I was wanting belarussia were somewhere lighters in a
room full of Harry as bikers and I played in the first half hour
of.</span>  

\[1:24:30\] <span title="1:24:30 - 1:24:40">Other sleeps in Seattle
there's a great liner supersa South were his kid phone's up the radio
station because his dad is lonely because his wife has died.</span>  
<span title="1:24:40 - 1:24:48">And he took the Radio DJ at the
Christmas Eve and she says tell me about your wife and again it's
fantastic cuz it's so simple.</span>  
<span title="1:24:48 - 1:24:57">Alex it's the only says she made
everything beautiful for she made everything beautiful and it just
actually slows you when you do.</span>  

\[1:24:58\] <span title="1:24:58 - 1:25:10">Because it's exactly want to
carry it feels and thinks there's no complexity it is a nice she made
everything beautiful it's a nice flight to The Lion and the truthfulness
kills I like stop very bikers.</span>  
<span title="1:25:11 - 1:25:19">It is pissing down there cheats and I
was swimming subtitles from half a little bit this week anyway so it is
when you get this going to simple stuff right.</span>  
<span title="1:25:20 - 1:25:23">Cuts to the kind of part of the audience
and also the character.</span>  

**Chas Fisher:**  
\[1:25:24\] <span title="1:25:24 - 1:25:30">But trying to trying to find
some I guess tools for people to analyse and improve their own
writing.</span>  

\[1:25:31\] <span title="1:25:31 - 1:25:36">I guess one of the things to
be to look for weight in a scene of any.</span>  
<span title="1:25:36 - 1:25:49">Reasonable length like more than half a
page do you have differences in resin like do you have two characters
speaking in different rhythms or do you have like we've got in this
example where they be introduced interruptions just to change up the
Rhythm.</span>  
<span title="1:25:49 - 1:25:58">Of the same because he had two
characters talking at the same way and with analyse this day you had in
a day.</span>  

**Stu Willis:**  
\[1:25:58\] <span title="1:25:58 - 1:25:59">Invert.</span>  

**Chas Fisher:**  
\[1:25:58\] <span title="1:25:58 - 1:26:09">Depending depending who was
talking to who in those different movements of the same there were
different rhythms to it whether it was question and answer or question
and answer or.</span>  

**Stephen Cleary:**  
\[1:26:09\] <span title="1:26:09 - 1:26:19">Depends who can wear 2
characters are in the story and what their relationship that's the point
that I like is a matches off or plays a Fatso in that his name plug a
before from remains of the day just dinner the book.</span>  
<span title="1:26:19 - 1:26:27">It's that's that's very flirty because
there are kind of the point in a relationship where they are either
going to kiss each other really don't know when I'm going to see if they
done.</span>  
<span title="1:26:27 - 1:26:36">And that is the closest thing to ever
come to be together and so that point is the weather status is he's a
housekeeper housekeeper he's a backflip.</span>  
<span title="1:26:36 - 1:26:47">He's such a high status no this is a
very stratified welder stories in it in the world of being over the
downstairs of an English country house so that status does make a
difference but she walks into his room.</span>  
<span title="1:26:47 - 1:26:52">You know he allowed here and he doesn't
make Canada so what you doing here and whatever she brings flowers
seeing stars.</span>  
<span title="1:26:52 - 1:27:04">Send flowers in his room so she's as it
we're bringing the feminine into this very male world and it started the
whole thing is about OK in this could be the synthesis of male or female
this is weird this is a pivotal moment they're absolutely.</span>  
<span title="1:27:05 - 1:27:11">So then there isn't an opposition there
is it's a short scene because we don't don't want to introduce other
elements.</span>  
<span title="1:27:11 - 1:27:20">Answer this time under the essential
they just exchanging it's the same rough length of sentences the same
the Camry kind of like two sides of the same coin.</span>  
<span title="1:27:20 - 1:27:21">And then at the end of the
film.</span>  

\[1:27:22\] <span title="1:27:22 - 1:27:35">The end of the scene rather
keep he will Jackson and you have this really simple language all the
way through the scene and then he says that I'm just something like I
read his books in order to broaden and widen my education is suddenly
his language is formal.</span>  
<span title="1:27:35 - 1:27:48">Done done completely different and that
sings the break he's decided to make he was not going to become is not
going to be her partner and the language Express is that that formality
makes her Retreat and full internet and it's also an affirmation
status.</span>  
<span title="1:27:48 - 1:28:02">You know I am a educated man who reads
books in order to educate myself I'm not pray to city emotions like
women have that's going to what he does it take to pull up but in that
scene then it's not a competitive knowledge is working in a competitive
edge complimentary.</span>  
<span title="1:28:02 - 1:28:09">This confirmation because they are kind
of together only until then and see what they can a fracture and if you
have characters who are.</span>  

\[1:28:10\] <span title="1:28:10 - 1:28:20">Very close to each other the
dollar does not compacted or is not exchanging so much a little the you
know that line and Blues Brothers were the tiny line in Brisbane I
really like work.</span>  
<span title="1:28:20 - 1:28:30">They look away J Cole it looks the back
of the car and the cops are behind them and there's this the two of them
in each week once as one word that's it series scene with a dollar has
only one wedding.</span>  
<span title="1:28:30 - 1:28:44">Having a shit while role as well as yeah
shit that's the thing I don't have to undergo shit you know and but the
neither of us has more than one work because they're completely on the
same level.</span>  
<span title="1:28:44 - 1:28:55">They both as well Jake and Elwood I
completely together they are essentially literally inoue Brothers and
there there's no so you couldn't put up a cigarette paper between them
so there's no dollar is almost identical.</span>  
<span title="1:28:55 - 1:28:59">I'm going to add an express as that can
closeness and a relationship without.</span>  

**Chas Fisher:**  
\[1:28:59\] <span title="1:28:59 - 1:29:02">Show me now I try and apply
what we've learnt to.</span>  

**Stu Willis:**

**Chas Fisher:**  
\[1:29:07\] <span title="1:29:07 - 1:29:19">Wheat wheat wheat chosen for
a number is it's Cuz that's what's a crowd scene so there's multiple
competing interests not just two people talking to each other.</span>  

**Stu Willis:**  
\[1:29:19\] <span title="1:29:19 - 1:29:21">Highton very similar status
characters.</span>  

**Chas Fisher:**  
\[1:29:22\] <span title="1:29:22 - 1:29:36">And it's at a point in the
film where it's having to do some heavy lifting for flight isn't the
right word but the characters all have to be at a different place at the
end of the scene and they were at the beginning with only
dialogue.</span>  

\[1:29:37\] <span title="1:29:37 - 1:29:49">Happening so the dollar was
having to move the characterisation in the relationships between his
characters of long-term this movement is resting in the Dialogue in the
interrelation between the characters not on.</span>

\[1:32:03\] <span title="1:32:03 - 1:32:11">Ok today tessera I can get
there as long as you were.</span>  

**Stu Willis:**  
\[1:32:22\] <span title="1:32:22 - 1:32:33">When we met I live it's just
a good piece of big print it sets up the same for the owner dialogue is
back in the ladders of these people keep rubbing off each other and at
any moment the shit will hit the fan.</span>  

\[1:32:33\] <span title="1:32:33 - 1:32:47">That's all I do to set up
and then going to the dialogue and it is interesting how are you can use
that kinda I guess big print to interpret dialogue and just go into it
go there's some actual lines but.</span>  

\[1:32:48\] <span title="1:32:48 - 1:33:03">You know there's more Parade
patpat parentheticals in this in terms of the actions to keep the
emphasis on the dialogue Tony puts his arm around Steve Steve pushes
Tony off Tony comes face to face with Kat you know it's just a little
bits of action just trying to keep.</span>  
<span title="1:33:03 - 1:33:10">I guess the iPhone focused on there on
the dialogue and reading through that sends a man that says
pure.</span>  

**Chas Fisher:**  
\[1:33:10\] <span title="1:33:10 - 1:33:11">Blocking staging.</span>  

**Stu Willis:**  
\[1:33:11\] <span title="1:33:11 - 1:33:20">Formatting blocking staging
but it's also just so you know it's not gonna make it craft any better
but.</span>  

**Chas Fisher:**  
\[1:33:20\] <span title="1:33:20 - 1:33:29">Let's sit there like what's
going on underneath this scene so we can see what if anything is
successfully being done in the dialogue so.</span>  

\[1:33:30\] <span title="1:33:30 - 1:33:39">They've been is the Avengers
have assembled as it we're but they're not they're all still individuals
in the room and Nick Fury wants them to all come together.</span>  

\[1:33:41\] <span title="1:33:41 - 1:33:55">Yeah and banner is pointing
that out expressly in dialogue and then there is a Steve Rogers pointing
out at it's almost like creating a character arc in dialogue which is
why it I think.</span>  

\[1:33:56\] <span title="1:33:56 - 1:34:06">It does pay a little corny
and wrong but in saying you're not the one to make the sacrifice play
where is the at the film ends with Tony Stark in.</span>  

**Stu Willis:**  
\[1:34:06\] <span title="1:34:06 - 1:34:08">Making sacrificing
himself.</span>  

**Chas Fisher:**  
\[1:34:08\] <span title="1:34:08 - 1:34:19">For the good of the world so
it's doing that's what I mean about heavy lifting in terms of it is
providing it's position but as providing character exposition not plot
exposition.</span>  
<span title="1:34:20 - 1:34:27">Which I think that's open it a challenge
for me and my writing is there are these.</span>  
<span title="1:34:27 - 1:34:41">You know you were supposed to put these
characters through these arts and sometimes you want to reinforce what
you've dramatised with like people saying in dialogue what is that
characters problem what are they going to have to overcome just like
spelling it out for the audience as.</span>  

\[1:34:42\] <span title="1:34:42 - 1:34:43">Has happened here.</span>  

\[1:34:44\] <span title="1:34:44 - 1:34:54">So did a success we are now
looking well I guess were looking at between does it really well here is
characterisation making just in dialogue like you said.</span>  
<span title="1:34:54 - 1:35:00">So if you took all the characters names
away from this you would have a very strong feeling for who's
talk.</span>  

**Stu Willis:**  
\[1:35:00\] <span title="1:35:00 - 1:35:08">I wonder if that's because
we hear you know there now so closely identify you know Thor is so
closely then It's Over Chris Hemsworth.</span>  
<span title="1:35:08 - 1:35:10">And start with with.</span>  
<span title="1:35:11 - 1:35:21">Robert Downey Jr bit I'm trying to make
a few observations here yet 40 minutes of status thing in terms of
minutes, maybe that's why point cook stuffed interesting to look at
because it is somewhat caricature.</span>  
<span title="1:35:21 - 1:35:30">Thor is pompous so he's language and you
always think he's better than everyone so you know you speak of chaos it
you caught 80 you speak of control yet you courthouse.</span>  

**Chas Fisher:**  
\[1:35:30\] <span title="1:35:30 - 1:35:38">There's a reason I got Ken
branagh to Direct the First full movie they wanted to pull off so
Shakespeare like pronouncements.</span>  

**Stu Willis:**  
\[1:35:37\] <span title="1:35:37 - 1:35:50">You know and I put photos up
other than when you need to say the plot line of Lupita doTERRA kept her
outside and that's it in switching into purely feeding the pot the pot
that there no new people so petty.</span>  
<span title="1:35:50 - 1:35:56">And tiny and the reason and tiny
itsfunneh is Cuz so petty is this high status.</span>  

\[1:35:56\] <span title="1:35:56 - 1:36:04">Word to do with his pompous
language and then button it with that and timing is kinda little bit of
a drop of status.</span>  

\[1:36:05\] <span title="1:36:05 - 1:36:15">Beyonce just the thing as
Steve Rogers is that he is from like 19:50 so he's going to speak more
about ura and you know that the contrast with him with.</span>  

**Chas Fisher:**  
\[1:36:15\] <span title="1:36:15 - 1:36:24">Does he doesn't like call
anyone daddy-o or anything like that where Steve Rogers I feel like it's
not in his language per say that.</span>  

\[1:36:25\] <span title="1:36:25 - 1:36:27">That it says I'm from the
fifties but it's in his.</span>  

\[1:36:29\] <span title="1:36:29 - 1:36:38">You know that that there is
in his challenges there is good and there is evil there are Americans in
the end there are Nazis you know that there's no Grey.</span>  

**Stephen Cleary:**  
\[1:36:38\] <span title="1:36:38 - 1:36:51">It's almost like really to
the characters in The seeing you soak I mean because it's an action
movie and because there is so just say things are so compressed because
you have so little time do you so much of a story is really about you
know when you watch the clip when you look at this.</span>  
<span title="1:36:51 - 1:37:06">You know seen what speed do the
underlying stuff take the scene is it there is that exploding device
that's been fired and you don't win the bottle is a bomb going off so
what you reap what you're really interested in is exactly what is a bomb
explode we should get a great.</span>  

\[1:37:06\] <span title="1:37:06 - 1:37:09">Classic cinematic.</span>  

**Chas Fisher:**  
\[1:37:09\] <span title="1:37:09 - 1:37:12">If you want it if you want
to do exposition have a bomb just sitting there.</span>  

**Stu Willis:**  
\[1:37:12\] <span title="1:37:12 - 1:37:17">Is it the time bomb of The
Avengers at the time.</span>  

**Chas Fisher:**  
\[1:37:17\] <span title="1:37:17 - 1:37:19">Apple x.</span>  

**Stephen Cleary:**  
\[1:37:18\] <span title="1:37:18 - 1:37:33">But you can't that's fine
what what the characters are as also they kind of tight so you will you
got to characterize a very quickly and you know you can also do this in
an awesome person and Steve is kind of a.</span>  
<span title="1:37:33 - 1:37:39">Integrity integrity and then he looks
like he's missed insulin.</span>  

\[1:37:40\] <span title="1:37:40 - 1:37:53">Everything is going to ride
the slay me and wheedling and it is very everything you said you were
something in the face you know that but that's that's what it is and
then banner is is kind of confused.</span>  
<span title="1:37:53 - 1:37:55">You don't moralist.</span>  

**Stu Willis:**  
\[1:37:55\] <span title="1:37:55 - 1:38:09">And he's got very similar
reading on the Patriots and the bird William in wow very similar very
similarities between Williams winning in 1990 Hill and how banners word
in here a lot of Sutton convoluted.</span>  

**Chas Fisher:**  
\[1:38:08\] <span title="1:38:08 - 1:38:14">Repeated words so is like no
no no it's impressive to see.</span>  

\[1:38:14\] <span title="1:38:14 - 1:38:24">But I mean it's not gonna be
bossy different from the page to the to the film but you can read their
performance on the page which I think is what we trying to get to
with.</span>  

\[1:38:25\] <span title="1:38:25 - 1:38:33">With this episode of drugs
zero but he he certainly is one of the characters I talked to the
longest here and just in.</span>  

\[1:38:34\] <span title="1:38:34 - 1:38:38">And he's almost like a Greek
chorus kind of characters of commentating on their action.</span>  

**Stephen Cleary:**  
\[1:38:38\] <span title="1:38:38 - 1:38:43">Within within his with his
speech you two degrees himself,</span>  
<span title="1:38:43 - 1:38:51">it's like I mean what I'll be 18 no no
no we're coming to make snake scales work wear a Time by Meghan It's
like these three again is speaking in threes,</span>  
<span title="1:38:51 - 1:39:00">honey and within that he's disagreeing
with himself and contradicts himself will receive know what is that
Springs own question is kind of and close it is only world it is all
really in,</span>  
<span title="1:39:00 - 1:39:09">he doesn't associate or relate to other
characters in the story as much cheese in it and by the fact that he
almost done a black explosion turns into.</span>  

\[1:39:09\] <span title="1:39:09 - 1:39:17">Turn to the whole half way
through this in because everything is internalise with a wheeze not
actually even though he's talking he's not really expressing for them
not really in a conversation.</span>  
<span title="1:39:17 - 1:39:20">The conversation is kind of with
himself.</span>  
<span title="1:39:20 - 1:39:35">You know I'm only tells you he's only
one in the scene to tell stories about you no idea I got no evidence
Hienz will put a bullet my father people spread out so I moved on by
telling his life story in the middle of a scene where it at all work and
I want to go to do when you know what the action they should,</span>  
<span title="1:39:35 - 1:39:37">so he's kind of.</span>  
<span title="1:39:37 - 1:39:45">Is not in those were the world of action
that's interesting so all the other characters in the world of action
have shorts under says because that's what you do in the world of
action.</span>  
<span title="1:39:45 - 1:39:54">This character is kind of withdrawn from
it has the longest beach in longer sentences in his he's not really
addressing his his darling it's not about what's happening right
now.</span>  
<span title="1:39:54 - 1:40:05">He quite quickly goes away from the
abstract if you like very very very very readily from all this so he and
improvise dialogue terms Italy nice counterpointed.</span>  
<span title="1:40:05 - 1:40:09">In a position in relation to the
characters who took a very directly to each other about.</span>  

**Stu Willis:**  
\[1:40:09\] <span title="1:40:09 - 1:40:17">This thing about banner
because he's a title in his a scientist of the language that he chooses
or women's shoes to use.</span>  

\[1:40:17\] <span title="1:40:17 - 1:40:26">Banner heat uses a metaphor
that is scientific know where I can make sure I'm bomb you know I'm in
Epping even that is just a very.</span>  

\[1:40:26\] <span title="1:40:26 - 1:40:41">Good example of that well
Steve like I know you know I know guys worth more than ten of you know
That Soulja thing you know the sacrifice by you know till a going away
I'll let the other guy for all over you like a soldier speak you know we
can identify.</span>  
<span title="1:40:41 - 1:40:50">Who these are and I think what's
interesting about Tony is she's asking what a question Tony is answering
in state.</span>  

\[1:40:50\] <span title="1:40:50 - 1:40:55">Berries that he a hero I
like you is Andrew still everything special about you came out of a
bottle.</span>  

**Chas Fisher:**  
\[1:40:55\] <span title="1:40:55 - 1:41:02">Better when I would like to
point out that is 23 previous lines have been equips but there's no
better way of putting it they've been equipped.</span>  

\[1:41:03\] <span title="1:41:03 - 1:41:10">Finally that he says more
than one sentence in a row is in response to Steve saying you better
stop pretending to be the hero.</span>  
<span title="1:41:10 - 1:41:21">In the parenthetical under Tony it says
that did it so something has prompted him like he's made a decision we
just made a decision for him to actually speak.</span>  
<span title="1:41:21 - 1:41:29">Longer and not just deliver a quick but
actually try and hurt because that's the other thing is that the things
that he's been saying before a bin.</span>  
<span title="1:41:29 - 1:41:42">To try and I guess get last there
haven't been a tax per say where is this isn't attack on Steve and you
know I need again at hero? Like you? You're a lab rat Rogers.</span>  

**Stu Willis:**  
\[1:41:41\] <span title="1:41:41 - 1:41:47">Dialogue lincet pretending
to be hero Stevens twenties Lane starts with a hero.</span>  
<span title="1:41:47 - 1:41:54">So I'm at Sonic hopefully we'll get into
an hour I'll follow up episode but that's a specific example or two
lines of dialogue completely.</span>  

**Stephen Cleary:**  
\[1:41:54\] <span title="1:41:54 - 1:41:55">Talking to each
other.</span>  

**Stu Willis:**  
\[1:41:55\] <span title="1:41:55 - 1:42:08">Looking into each other cuz
Tony didn't have to say that but you better stop pretending to be a hero
and turning could just go on your lab rat or as a laboratory experiments
and then in the clear but they deliver we hook them together probably to
show.</span>  

\[1:42:09\] <span title="1:42:09 - 1:42:17">That was the thing that got
to Tony Stark if they lied about the Hero by him repeating it's actually
referring to the audience that was the thing that knocked him.</span>  
<span title="1:42:17 - 1:42:31">Knocked him off and it did you kill like
High School English study in poetry but going back to the dentist Beach
which which I really which I found really affecting you know that I did
CNN so I put a bullet in my mouth in the other guys spit it
out.</span>  
<span title="1:42:31 - 1:42:32">What's interesting.</span>  
<span title="1:42:32 - 1:42:43">Is that the it's the use of the so
bullet mouth they're all kinds of long I sound and then other guy same
thing and then spit it out.</span>  
<span title="1:42:43 - 1:42:52">The continents kinda gives it this real
punctuation that ivacy Mark Ruffalo is able to play up in his
performance but it's there on the page and you can even read
it.</span>  

**Chas Fisher:**  
\[1:42:53\] <span title="1:42:53 - 1:42:58">It's interesting that for me
these it is even this scene.</span>  
<span title="1:42:58 - 1:43:07">Ok see you soon a lot of heavy lifting
for character because it's basically laying the groundwork for the
emotional journey of a character journey of Bruce Banner
saying.</span>  
<span title="1:43:07 - 1:43:16">What makes him angry what you know how
does he keep in control wait what is his relationship with the hold it's
got Tony's is laying down Tony's.</span>  

**Stu Willis:**  
\[1:43:16\] <span title="1:43:16 - 1:43:17">Desire to be a
hero.</span>  

**Chas Fisher:**  
\[1:43:17\] <span title="1:43:17 - 1:43:28">Designer be a hero and also
his challenge to be a hero because it's been said again it's like his
floor is being put in the mouth of another character and Steve the whole
thing the lead into this scene that we.</span>  
<span title="1:43:29 - 1:43:38">Tally them getting equipment will be
able to Steves in a black and white Mr Integrity but he's just found
that the team is playing on is using.</span>  
<span title="1:43:38 - 1:43:45">Essentially has atomic weapons on board
or chemical weapons and has a bad thing that he disagrees with his
having a question his own.</span>  

**Stephen Cleary:**  
\[1:43:46\] <span title="1:43:46 - 1:43:55">Nothing back complex at
complex position Steve is an all the addictive contract between as it
was a simple will the simple rules the world Stevens in a complex world
is actually it.</span>  
<span title="1:43:55 - 1:44:09">Is is in the is when I sit down the line
between Stephen Tony where is the big man in a suit of armour take that
off what are you simple words simple statement and then the reply that
Tony gives a genius billionaire Playboy lamp.</span>  

\[1:44:09\] <span title="1:44:09 - 1:44:19">These are in a in some ways
a Playboy genius a philanthropist that the kind of these words are not
that exactly contradictory they're not.</span>  
<span title="1:44:19 - 1:44:24">Each other but not complimentary there's
a Chinese reply is faithful the long word.</span>  
<span title="1:44:24 - 1:44:36">A genius. Playboy philanthropist is the
longest word in the same so so so feel a lot better I'm so kind
of.</span>  
<span title="1:44:36 - 1:44:43">To Steve's for the simple statement of
morality is kind of a person is saying the world is more complicated
than your analysis.</span>  
<span title="1:44:43 - 1:44:51">You know and my words are also more
complicated than yours and it said it is that contract Peter simple
words of 1940.</span>  
<span title="1:44:51 - 1:45:00">Morality Elizabeth complex words of a
21st century morality where things are really complicated in a difficult
to know 22222 digico,</span>  
<span title="1:45:00 - 1:45:13">deconstruct I could come up I just say
with a clevaquip at that point we could have the right of it I put in a
clever little phrase we choose and again it's the rhythm of ingenious
Ballina play Boy for Love.</span>  
<span title="1:45:13 - 1:45:15">Duh duh duh duh duh.</span>  

**Chas Fisher:**  
\[1:45:15\] <span title="1:45:15 - 1:45:20">And the choice of the order
of that word of those work for words would have been very
carefully.</span>  

**Stephen Cleary:**  
\[1:45:20\] <span title="1:45:20 - 1:45:31">As if you did it exactly did
a Playboy.</span>  
<span title="1:45:32 - 1:45:39">That's it that's a direct challenge if I
say I'm listen I'm better than you so he's not in the end with
genius.</span>  
<span title="1:45:39 - 1:45:49">Is a kind of declarative you know this
I'm great and you're not kind of her kind of sentences so they can which
words coming really important.</span>  
<span title="1:45:50 - 1:45:57">Is the last word in this in this list of
things he is the last wish is a good thing so you put to the world the
last thing which is the most.</span>  

\[1:45:58\] <span title="1:45:58 - 1:46:00">Murray approvable saying
that he.</span>  

**Chas Fisher:**  
\[1:46:00\] <span title="1:46:00 - 1:46:01">And the longest
word.</span>  

**Stephen Cleary:**  
\[1:46:01\] <span title="1:46:01 - 1:46:08">And the longest word at the
end of the sentence I know you like it is like a silly things predicted
to go to this detail,</span>  
<span title="1:46:08 - 1:46:19">at this dinner but actually you can
imagine you know the number of times when you actually shooting
something and talk to the action rehearsing we just says about which
words come in what order are absolutely crucial be made it tells
you.</span>  
<span title="1:46:19 - 1:46:28">You know the thing that Tony wants to
leave Steve where it is I'm a philanthropist that's the last thing he
wanted to take away and that tells you something about the car.</span>  
<span title="1:46:29 - 1:46:32">But whoever he has a has a moral ass
back.</span>  
<span title="1:46:32 - 1:46:47">Chas in with the notion of you know
Daddy to be a hero and it's like which way get some because you know him
so he does see himself as having a moral you know of course it is a
fight if a joke isn't true he is not a fake.</span>  

\[1:46:47\] <span title="1:46:47 - 1:46:54">You know and body sensitive
to visitation because you're so rich and because he's a billionaire
because a playable address as well you're a fake.</span>  
<span title="1:46:54 - 1:47:04">How many says you're in a when that
accusation is pretending to be a hero he's getting straight to the half
of what Tony is stock is really casino size weight or is it will press
this button.</span>  
<span title="1:47:04 - 1:47:12">Because he is in a he is a genuine hero
who dresses up as genuine moral belief and it kind of postmodern
cynicism.</span>  
<span title="1:47:12 - 1:47:23">Way likes to know show himself off as
being actually I'm just too I'm just a tosser do you know who goes right
to see a bit of fact that hides aggression of a real Simplicity and a
moral virtue that is kind of Summer to stay.</span>  
<span title="1:47:24 - 1:47:28">Not less or Morrison Steve is but he
doesn't he just guys as it more me know he wears a suit.</span>  

**Stu Willis:**  
\[1:47:29\] <span title="1:47:29 - 1:47:37">I don't think that
relationship is like all the sequels are coming out of it you know I'm
in the hole.</span>  

\[1:47:37\] <span title="1:47:37 - 1:47:48">Avengers civil war is it
Steve vs Tony and you can see it right there that can't I do the back
24th 1940 morality vs 21st century morality.</span>  

**Chas Fisher:**  
\[1:47:48\] <span title="1:47:48 - 1:47:58">And that's what the Winter
Soldier it's like Steve's journey in this situation in the scene is
played out over the whole of the Winter Soldier just so catch
America.</span>  

\[1:47:59\] <span title="1:47:59 - 1:48:06">I think I just what I wanted
to wonder is what I wanted to look at this is to just show people that
it did it we are not limited to.</span>  

\[1:48:06\] <span title="1:48:06 - 1:48:12">Talk about these things in
in two people contacts in contacts films like remains of the day on
stuff like that it's.</span>  

\[1:48:13\] <span title="1:48:13 - 1:48:26">The all of these the reason
why these lines work why they sing while they're why the dialogue in two
players so great is because it is coming from the characters perspective
and it is characterising them.</span>  

**Stu Willis:**  
\[1:48:26\] <span title="1:48:26 - 1:48:41">Xxx position of character is
feeling character and then I meant this is kind of a good scenes home
and went because it was quite but you can see how you can then borrow
that down William is a guy that indecisive so he's language is
in.</span>  
<span title="1:48:41 - 1:48:42">Decisive.</span>  
<span title="1:48:42 - 1:48:55">You know and a vid is a guy that is used
to having power and needs to reaffirm his power saw uses question like
it do you understand me as a way to reaffirming his power but that also
tyres review.</span>  
<span title="1:48:55 - 1:49:03">A panic attack in really think about a
cousin that even is repetition of panic that's what a Paddington you're
actually sounds panicked.</span>  
<span title="1:49:03 - 1:49:07">By saying panic like it's it's actually
demonstrating.</span>  
<span title="1:49:07 - 1:49:15">You know the dialogue or dialogue is
reviewing character and actually is dramatizing it too and there is that
a perception but there is always that.</span>  

\[1:49:16\] <span title="1:49:16 - 1:49:23">Training of the Damned If I
do the dialogue copy action you know that very very going to write a
screenplay then you have the dialogue.</span>  

\[1:49:23\] <span title="1:49:23 - 1:49:33">Paraphrase Hitchcock but I
think what we showing here is that the dialogue by adding a dialogue
you're actually reviewing what's going on underneath and maybe you
know.</span>  

**Chas Fisher:**  
\[1:49:32\] <span title="1:49:32 - 1:49:40">And they do the analyse that
scene it's all action in dialogue it's it's the passing of a baton back
and forth about who's in control.</span>  
<span title="1:49:41 - 1:49:52">Pencils and of the scene and of the
interaction and what I like about this particular scene I is I would
have been really interested to see how the scene played out if they
hadn't had.</span>  
<span title="1:49:52 - 1:49:59">The b b beat of the computer and the
time bomb go off like it would have been it quite fascinating to see how
this plays out.</span>  

**Stephen Cleary:**  
\[1:49:59\] <span title="1:49:59 - 1:50:08">Anyway what's interesting
when you look at this you know so you get the impression that it's kind
of because when you write in this cause of action film it's so
difficult,</span>  
<span title="1:50:08 - 1:50:20">I'm into the craft in this scene is
really remarkable it's not the least things are in each kind of seems
there is evident as if you if you read if you were looking at them
remains the day or Richard Curtis work,</span>  
<span title="1:50:20 - 1:50:25">you have more time because this kind of
the stories are about interaction to him people,</span>  
<span title="1:50:25 - 1:50:30">20 about the relationship that is easy
as a character page story when you would actually story like
this,</span>  
<span title="1:50:30 - 1:50:35">you look at this new thing ok how would
you write this how would you really set out to write this have to work
it out for you.</span>  

\[1:50:36\] <span title="1:50:36 - 1:50:45">I need sex with it what you
want this reads like when you look at it and it's finished form is it
going to boil down and service in the first half an hour a day
Geelong.</span>  
<span title="1:50:45 - 1:50:59">Were you looking to go to who are these
characters what are they feeling a bit thinking about where are they and
you've right you know exchanges a look in her daughter just identify
cause of the essence of what it is in a social thing,</span>  
<span title="1:50:59 - 1:51:08">that we have to show about banner in the
same nothing else and then as you rewrite and rewrite and rewrite you
boil and buy them all and what you go to the end is it gonna juice you
know when you make,</span>  
<span title="1:51:09 - 1:51:21">do the French have it worth Repco oil in
a bath you know or half a swimming pool,</span>  
<span title="1:51:20 - 1:51:29">that's the absolute quintessence of the
flavour that you want and it is with this kind of right thing is about
that know whether the rated does this in their head.</span>  
<span title="1:51:29 - 1:51:40">I literally just think something some
things and comes out and compressed worth it with Practice you probably
can do that but I think you know it's it's a really good he's at work
you know how it happened you get this level of intensity of.</span>  

\[1:51:41\] <span title="1:51:41 - 1:51:43">Of the scene be only about
what has to be about a nothing else.</span>  
<span title="1:51:44 - 1:51:53">And the dialogue being so laconic and so
spa and yet doing the job I think it's about we write in a we writing in
every rewrite comes a little bit shorter,</span>  
<span title="1:51:53 - 1:52:01">little bit shorter until I get so short
it doesn't make sense and expand it a little bit back out there to get
the right without the right level boiled away isn't it.</span>  

**Chas Fisher:**  
\[1:52:01\] <span title="1:52:01 - 1:52:11">I love that point in
screenwriting where I've gone to a driveway people start saying you need
more not less cuz you just packed it back to that.</span>  

**Stu Willis:**  
\[1:52:11\] <span title="1:52:11 - 1:52:25">Yeah I guess you have been
in my head you know that idea if I you know you got it cuttings cuddle
fat just get it down to the the the me anyway but in me fat is where the
flavour it it's being careful so it's not too bad.</span>  

**Chas Fisher:**  
\[1:52:26\] <span title="1:52:26 - 1:52:31">Rotarians adjust great what
what are the people doing that it's disgusting Eric Alba.</span>  

**Stu Willis:**  
\[1:52:31\] <span title="1:52:31 - 1:52:40">I mean I was going to say
mushrooms and that's awesome way to eat mushrooms bring something absorb
the Suzanne,</span>  
<span title="1:52:40 - 1:52:51">that's why I of all people talk about
cooking I'm sorry I'm not that we've talked about in touch,</span>  
<span title="1:52:51 - 1:52:55">the follow-up is that idea that shared
language is a way of showing groups in AU.</span>  
<span title="1:52:55 - 1:53:05">Technical vocabulary is a way of
becoming part of your group inciting incident 3rd at protagonist I'm
part of the group it's right it's right.</span>  

\[1:53:05\] <span title="1:53:05 - 1:53:09">You actually know what any
of that shit man and a lot of people don't.</span>  

**Chas Fisher:**  
\[1:53:09\] <span title="1:53:09 - 1:53:16">Have you guys seen the
Martian ok one of the things that I really liked about it is yes they
do.</span>  

\[1:53:16\] <span title="1:53:16 - 1:53:29">Reduced really complex
scientific been to Hollywood Babble but not too late the usual
kindergarten level they left there at Lakeside no High School
physics.</span>  

**Stu Willis:**  
\[1:53:28\] <span title="1:53:28 - 1:53:30">You have there.</span>  

**Chas Fisher:**  
\[1:53:33\] <span title="1:53:33 - 1:53:46">They didn't care if everyone
understood it or not because that's because that was what has to be true
to the characters and then like a help the Matt Damon would have like a
very self-deprecating usually have at the end of each line.</span>  
<span title="1:53:46 - 1:53:55">So basically this means I have to live
off this much me for the days just said I hope you know that this huge
allina me just sums it up in a joke.</span>  

\[1:53:56\] <span title="1:53:56 - 1:54:01">But yeah I think what you're
talking about shared language and I think we've seen it here you
know.</span>  

**Stu Willis:**  
\[1:54:01\] <span title="1:54:01 - 1:54:02">Notting Hill now.</span>  

**Chas Fisher:**  
\[1:54:02\] <span title="1:54:02 - 1:54:10">Notting Hill we saw them
talking like each other um so I'm really looking forward to our follow
up episode.</span>  

**Stu Willis:**  
\[1:54:10\] <span title="1:54:10 - 1:54:18">If innocent people are found
another time ok I'm ok I'm invited it doesn't feel that I message her
good character.</span>  

## Wrap Up / Tools

\[1:54:18\] <span title="1:54:18 - 1:54:31">Voice writing a waving to my
characters what is some things that we can do to this is Mr we looking
at a really amazing scenes written by really Top Ryde at work.</span>  

\[1:54:31\] <span title="1:54:31 - 1:54:43">Doing really great stuff
right in the final form but most the time after picking up with black
shift for a long time right what are some stuff that we can do so at
least that gap between what we want to achieve.</span>  
<span title="1:54:43 - 1:54:46">And we are achieving can kind of
clothes.</span>  

**Stephen Cleary:**  
\[1:54:46\] <span title="1:54:46 - 1:54:56">Almost I was amazing I'm
looking to send that that we talked to the beginning amount of mining in
to size does the underlying dramatic structure of the sea in a nurse the
way the techniques of dialogue.</span>  
<span title="1:54:56 - 1:55:10">First of all this is never going to fly
unless you've got the underlying stuff right so you have to know what
they actually the scene is where it's going who's driving the actual to
see what Decisions are made you're in the Senate put the actual forward
so where are the as a moment the beat in the scene where the action is
move,</span>  
<span title="1:55:10 - 1:55:13">what the question if you like the drive
the plots of the seed.</span>  
<span title="1:55:13 - 1:55:26">What is the main character seen the
protagonist and sing trying to achieve what's an object of the scene
where is objective shit by the further towards getting it or further
away from it so you understand and alone architect.</span>  
<span title="1:55:26 - 1:55:35">Yep no other then you have to say to
yourself that is seen that has too much as a text with as opposed to
subject.</span>  
<span title="1:55:35 - 1:55:44">I'm is a Scene It's always will be very
flat and devil too mate work mostly character spend most the times in
scenes not talking about the truth.</span>  
<span title="1:55:44 - 1:55:54">Septum take ok sleep baby The Avengers
here where we come into a crisis and the shift to sit in the phone as
well as a cab there speaking true to each other brother think about each
other most of the time.</span>  

**Chas Fisher:**  
\[1:55:54\] <span title="1:55:54 - 1:55:59">Only banner really gets to
the point minutes speaking about the truth about what they think about
each other but.</span>  

**Stu Willis:**  
\[1:55:59\] <span title="1:55:59 - 1:56:00">Not themselves.</span>  

**Stephen Cleary:**  
\[1:56:00\] <span title="1:56:00 - 1:56:03">Where's the
subject.</span>  
<span title="1:56:03 - 1:56:12">What's a subject in your seen an
unlikely so so as in what's the Dynamic movement to the action to see
what's a subject the same when does the text as when does subjects come
above the surface,</span>  
<span title="1:56:12 - 1:56:18">when did when did the scene do the
characters say absolutely the truth with no elaboration and that's
exactly what they think.</span>  
<span title="1:56:18 - 1:56:26">Answer should be at specific moments
that you have designed that I wear and therefore peak moments in the
scene so you answered that that.</span>  
<span title="1:56:26 - 1:56:39">That's my understanding of underlying
stuff now think about your characters what are the individual voices
your characters have what are the social context what's that background
why would they talk the way they talk where were the educated what are
the attitudes,</span>  
<span title="1:56:39 - 1:56:48">you know to the people that talking to
where is the end of the year did who had the control the power and see
it may not be the same as a person who controls the axe.</span>  
<span title="1:56:48 - 1:56:53">How does he always understand who the
most powerful person is when does the power ship.</span>  
<span title="1:56:54 - 1:57:07">I'm what happens when that power
shifting how does a dialogue why do people being truthful lying lying to
themselves not being honest to themselves the language you become all
night till because got a smoke Square.</span>  
<span title="1:57:07 - 1:57:13">When they're being truthful it has to be
simplified when people have a potential to each other language will be
simpler.</span>  

\[1:57:13\] <span title="1:57:13 - 1:57:18">What kind words these people
use and how do you pattern and rhythmically organise the
carrot.</span>  
<span title="1:57:19 - 1:57:28">So they have a kind of music to them so
think about you know if it's a if there are gem call Con overeducated or
a meandering kind of character how will the language express
that,</span>  
<span title="1:57:28 - 1:57:35">and where does where would they go where
would you go against that pattern of David what makes people jerk out of
a normal pap as a speaker.</span>  
<span title="1:57:35 - 1:57:46">What might happen in the sea in that
would do that so you have it you have to get a sense of the overall
nature of the person at a sensor therefore the way that they would talk
then within that look at the way you will see in runs.</span>  

\[1:57:46\] <span title="1:57:46 - 1:57:54">You're very sweet to say
whatever it all looks of it saying it and it says the people attending
to talk about the same amount did sensor telling me about the same
Lan.</span>  
<span title="1:57:55 - 1:58:02">How does the length of the sentence is
reflective as with a pace and limit of the story within the same as
though you just have a very in a sentence.</span>  
<span title="1:58:02 - 1:58:11">Even with the contractor however long or
short these people senses are it is a perfect s talking shorts and this
is make the census shorter at some point and longer than some,</span>  
<span title="1:58:11 - 1:58:24">satac a very that and less than speaking
in Rosebery long service again how does it move around do you have a can
of a pattern Rhythm of the way the characters speaking will probably
talk more about this later and the second one but actually had them
bounce off each other.</span>  
<span title="1:58:24 - 1:58:33">What kind of F1 character is a kind of
music to their voice what happens when the other instrument comes in
what effect does that have and having a phone if you're up two or three
card.</span>  
<span title="1:58:34 - 1:58:43">How does patterns and rhythms bounce off
each other I say to write to think of your characters in your story as
different instruments in an orchestra.</span>  

\[1:58:43\] <span title="1:58:43 - 1:58:52">So what instrument think of
each of your characters and what instrument characterizes that the
undersea the flute and violin in our trumpet what are they.</span>  
<span title="1:58:52 - 1:58:59">And I need and when do they play in and
then think of the unit that which makes you start thinking of their
voices as sounds rather than.</span>  
<span title="1:58:59 - 1:59:09">Collections of words which means
something cause I think you got always having them having your head this
notion that there's also there's what people say and there's a sound
they make when they're saying it.</span>  
<span title="1:59:09 - 1:59:15">And the audience is interested in the
sound they make is a saying it as they are and what they say.</span>  
<span title="1:59:15 - 1:59:24">So what you're right and I like for his
not just to have them say things but you also having a make a sound and
that that sound is really crucial to do it is enjoyment of the
carrot.</span>  

**Chas Fisher:**  
\[1:59:24\] <span title="1:59:24 - 1:59:25">There's a visual.</span>  

\[1:59:26\] <span title="1:59:26 - 1:59:36">Corollary analogy to that
where apparently cause I'm doing a holiday reception Tower brain thing
from my current script apparently whenever we look at something were
only actually.</span>  
<span title="1:59:36 - 1:59:40">Seeing interpreting new information or
about 4%.</span>  
<span title="1:59:40 - 1:59:51">And 96% is constructed from what we
previously seen what were assuming it's unsafe and from cinematic
purposes that the reason why you always want us focuses
because.</span>  
<span title="1:59:51 - 2:00:01">Most detailed that we store about any
person is around the around the eyes though.</span>  

**Stu Willis:**  
\[2:00:01\] <span title="2:00:01 - 2:00:06">That's good good stuff even
thank you so much until.</span>  

**Chas Fisher:**  
\[2:00:03\] <span title="2:00:03 - 2:00:06">Till next time.</span>

## Backmatter - Theatrical, Televisual And Cinematic Dialogue

\[2:00:24\] <span title="2:00:24 - 2:00:25">And now.</span>  

**Stu Willis:**  
\[2:00:31\] <span title="2:00:31 - 2:00:41">Very this maybe this
perception like when I was like I want to get when I was like thinking
and I was wicked Island I started reading what a plays cause I was like
what is a play.</span>  

\[2:00:41\] <span title="2:00:41 - 2:00:49">Just dialogue does screen
storytelling dialogue have it's Origins in theatre or is it actually
something else.</span>  

**Stephen Cleary:**  
\[2:00:49\] <span title="2:00:49 - 2:00:52">I would I you strongly that
it's not.</span>  
<span title="2:00:52 - 2:01:04">The movies with silent before they were
talking so you know that it's really important one to stand there so I
think I'm thinking about dialogue is there when the movie started
narrative Cinema started it was silent there wasn't it.</span>  
<span title="2:01:05 - 2:01:15">And people to people were telling
stories without the necessity of dialogue because technically was
impossible to have it and then when they look kind of started coming
into screen stories.</span>  
<span title="2:01:15 - 2:01:21">Cinema stories he came in and get a
surprising ways always that without think about it came in through
intertitles.</span>  
<span title="2:01:21 - 2:01:32">So didn't hear character speak for quite
a long time and then when characters disc we go again technically they
were quite a lot of adjustments that I made around and the 2013 in order
to allow.</span>  
<span title="2:01:32 - 2:01:40">Found to be recorded properly and they
also serve like a lot intermediate stages were you couldn't move the
camera and very much because the sound of it,</span>  
<span title="2:01:41 - 2:01:49">the film go to the shutter was too loud
and see how to make a soundproof box and put the camera the box so what
then happened was you film theatrical show.</span>  
<span title="2:01:49 - 2:01:56">The Marx Brothers example work in the
Hay Day at them early days of Sound because they took the much for the
stage shows of film them.</span>  
<span title="2:01:56 - 2:02:05">So the first introduction of Sound was a
break and very very if you like the Mark's me that's going to virtuoso
Dialogue.</span>  
<span title="2:02:05 - 2:02:09">Got a fast asset got a Broadway speak
and he's going to which seasons.</span>  
<span title="2:02:09 - 2:02:23">An an an clever weird because when
you're standing still on the stage and you're taking orders if you're
not doing anything you ask your conversation has been very entertaining
very busy and that's why the most was going to say I'm so so so busy but
then when you can move a camera around.</span>  

\[2:02:24\] <span title="2:02:24 - 2:02:37">Then you're not it's not
necessary to have a character who is it about holding the story with the
way they speak and if that is some ways it becomes a problem if you have
a character that sold in the story where this week because a cinematic
invited to move the come around to cut.</span>  
<span title="2:02:37 - 2:02:46">United to tell the story of it in a
complex visual way using sound as a and a company that take me to not as
the primary 2.</span>  
<span title="2:02:46 - 2:02:52">Raising the theatre you could argue that
dialogue is almost the primary method of communication.</span>  
<span title="2:02:53 - 2:02:57">You know that the characters speaking is
really more than 50% of what it is.</span>  
<span title="2:02:57 - 2:03:03">I'm in it again it's massive
generalisation but broadly speaking YouTube oh that so so it's things
change.</span>  

**Chas Fisher:**  
\[2:03:04\] <span title="2:03:04 - 2:03:11">So Beau willimon The Creator
and showrunner of House of Cards he deliberately hires.</span>  
<span title="2:03:11 - 2:03:24">Appraise writers room along with
screenwriters playwrights then screenwriters because of their ability to
maintain an audience of interest over a great length ever seen when it
is not just dialogue it.</span>  
<span title="2:03:24 - 2:03:33">The interplay between two people or more
people but really it's about the communication between the characters it
that you're watching.</span>  

**Stu Willis:**  
\[2:03:32\] <span title="2:03:32 - 2:03:34">As expressed through
dialogue.</span>  

**Chas Fisher:**  
\[2:03:33\] <span title="2:03:33 - 2:03:38">Yes and how to maintain
interest through that and little else.</span>  

**Stephen Cleary:**  
\[2:03:38\] <span title="2:03:38 - 2:03:45">It also means because when
we talk about Dialogue in a little while I can an example to my darling
and television as per darling and cinnamon.</span>  
<span title="2:03:45 - 2:03:54">Your Daleks starting Cinema wooden
cinema is more visually Express than television so and so television
somewhere between if you like theatre and cinema,</span>  
<span title="2:03:54 - 2:04:03">the television dialogue is somewhere
between $30 v Cinema Tyler is in in cinema dialogue is nowhere near as
important as it isn't elevit.</span>  
<span title="2:04:04 - 2:04:07">When is the weed has to be carried on
the dial of a lot more than it is the cinema.</span>  

\[2:04:09\] <span title="2:04:09 - 2:04:17">We had when we're thinking
of you know when we're thinking of dialogue it so we talk about elyos if
we can you know you can interchange Cinema Tyler for television Tyler
and if have the latest is quite the.</span>  
<span title="2:04:17 - 2:04:27">Have an evil within television use a
certain kinds of television is more ways away cinematic weather / less
Karen of a dial and other kinds of television are more in a theatrical
that's it.</span>  

**Stu Willis:**  
\[2:04:27\] <span title="2:04:27 - 2:04:40">You had a mate that she
became ready with pictures but that is a theory or if not a fact that's
my the reference that the idea behind so proper is was that it was a
story that you would tell through sound so back in the day.</span>  

\[2:04:41\] <span title="2:04:41 - 2:04:46">Return on May or whatever
they can turn on the TV and leave it on while they do.</span>  

\[2:04:47\] <span title="2:04:47 - 2:05:00">The house work or whatever
and then can still follow the story and I think that is an interesting
test if you going on Young and the Restless and sound in the other room
you can still follow what's going on but that would be a lot harder with
say Breaking Bad or The Sopranos.</span>  
<span title="2:05:00 - 2:05:05">All magic shows that really pushed the
kind of visual poll ASB.</span>
