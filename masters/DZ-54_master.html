<span title="2:02 - 2:06" data-start="00:02:02.374" data-end="00:02:05.709" data-spk="3" data-label="Stephen Cleary">briefly out sections of a story,</span><br>
<span title="2:06 - 2:19" data-start="00:02:05.752" data-end="00:02:18.677" data-spk="3" data-label="Stephen Cleary">there is no determine length of them late and it's features to be around 12 minutes on average can be long I can be sure to in television drama that can build tend to be shorter near town on average but again there's no set length,</span><br>
<span title="2:19 - 2:26" data-start="00:02:18.941" data-end="00:02:26.458" data-spk="3" data-label="Stephen Cleary">Saving Private Ryan for example hasn't it Mexican 26 minutes so depending on me what's going on in the sequence um what's going on the story the changes,</span><br>
<span title="2:27 - 2:36" data-start="00:02:26.579" data-end="00:02:36.361" data-spk="3" data-label="Stephen Cleary">the defining a cat resting the sequences it it's if you like a chapter of a story that has a distinct in a feel that when you arrive at the end of it you very evil rugby under the face of the story</span><br>
<span title="2:36 - 2:42" data-start="00:02:36.290" data-end="00:02:42.400" data-spk="3" data-label="Stephen Cleary">and the sequences driven in a plot sequence by 1/8 in question there are lots of,</span><br>
<span title="2:42 - 2:48" data-start="00:02:42.413" data-end="00:02:47.953" data-spk="3" data-label="Stephen Cleary">what questions that are raised in answered or raised and answered later in the story but within the sequences,</span><br>
<span title="2:48 - 2:58" data-start="00:02:48.007" data-end="00:02:57.718" data-spk="3" data-label="Stephen Cleary">one sequence question which is the saying what is the plot question that this sequence raises to the surface asks explores and answers within the,</span><br>
<span title="2:58 - 2:59" data-start="00:02:57.964" data-end="00:02:58.943" data-spk="3" data-label="Stephen Cleary">sequence Excel,</span><br>
<span title="2:59 - 3:11" data-start="00:02:59.130" data-end="00:03:11.010" data-spk="3" data-label="Stephen Cleary">and then usually that answer has a consequence so because the answer is what it is something happen so because that something happens very often leads you just the beginning of the next sequence a question.</span><br>

<span title="3:26 - 3:29" data-start="00:03:25.690" data-end="00:03:29.499" data-spk="3" data-label="Stephen Cleary">in a big big action movies have those kinds of questions,</span><br>
<span title="3:30 - 3:38" data-start="00:03:29.728" data-end="00:03:37.876" data-spk="3" data-label="Stephen Cleary">can you have a clock character sequence weather is still the primary question in the sequence the most important one is 2 question,</span><br>
<span title="3:38 - 3:41" data-start="00:03:38.111" data-end="00:03:40.935" data-spk="3" data-label="Stephen Cleary">but it tends to be rather slightly looser question,</span><br>
<span title="3:41 - 3:55" data-start="00:03:41.140" data-end="00:03:54.924" data-spk="3" data-label="Stephen Cleary">it's not quite so driven and it's really there till late 140 character so because this is happening in the story whatever the plot question is that gives the writer an opportunity to the audience not because you want to stand the people better so that their the plot,</span><br>
<span title="3:55 - 3:58" data-start="00:03:55.141" data-end="00:03:58.115" data-spk="3" data-label="Stephen Cleary">character a question stimulus-driven less,</span><br>
<span title="3:58 - 4:10" data-start="00:03:58.253" data-end="00:04:10.073" data-spk="3" data-label="Stephen Cleary">emphatic slows the pacing of the story down with them and that slowing down the plot the character going to sleep through the cracks it says it's a mechanism to Orem I mean destructuring to allow that can have characters to come,</span><br>

<span title="4:26 - 4:35" data-start="00:04:26.135" data-end="00:04:35.467" data-spk="3" data-label="Stephen Cleary">The plot character sequence will be something like you know for example will this person managed to attract attention of that woman,</span><br>
<span title="4:36 - 4:48" data-start="00:04:35.732" data-end="00:04:48.116" data-spk="3" data-label="Stephen Cleary">so it's something that could be much more leisurely and actually what you're doing is you're using that attempt at this man may have with this woman may have to trap the tension another woman the kind of explore the character of that person who is looking to catch the person's attention</span><br>
<span title="4:48 - 4:57" data-start="00:04:48.069" data-end="00:04:56.571" data-spk="3" data-label="Stephen Cleary">how do I say to a degree to draw the character of the other person say it say it say it means by which you keep the story moving forward,</span><br>
<span title="4:57 - 5:02" data-start="00:04:56.722" data-end="00:05:02.189" data-spk="3" data-label="Stephen Cleary">but not at such a driven paste that means that you have to get a stop think about the characters.</span><br>
<span title="5:03 - 5:11" data-start="00:05:02.635" data-end="00:05:11.341" data-spk="3" data-label="Stephen Cleary">That a character sequence is where really want these what's going on in the story is primarily you looking to 140 character,</span><br>
<span title="5:11 - 5:19" data-start="00:05:11.492" data-end="00:05:18.907" data-spk="3" data-label="Stephen Cleary">and you're not that concerned with plot it is a much more less frequent than will wrap because they're more difficult.</span><br>
<span title="5:19 - 5:27" data-start="00:05:19.232" data-end="00:05:26.622" data-spk="3" data-label="Stephen Cleary">Because if you imagine telling a story while you're saying within this say 10-15 minutes section of the store I don't really want to have much plot.</span><br>
<span title="5:27 - 5:38" data-start="00:05:26.977" data-end="00:05:38.454" data-spk="3" data-label="Stephen Cleary">Send the question then becomes a y z what he's interested cause normally what pools and what is requested what's going to happen next even if you were having a character go in a sewer story if you see what I'm having a car to go for a story but I'm not that bothered,</span><br>
<span title="5:39 - 5:46" data-start="00:05:38.563" data-end="00:05:46.218" data-spk="3" data-label="Stephen Cleary">about the autistic and what is going to happen to that character next then you're gonna throw in the audience back on the one thing which is who is this person really.</span><br>
